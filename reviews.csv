13913,80770,40408,177109,Michael,"My girlfriend and I hadn't known Alina before we took the leap of faith to rent her flat. Alina just couldn't be nicer! Her flat is comfortable, homey, very sunny, and quiet at night. Her diverse neighborhood rocks! It's full of excellent eateries of varying ethnicities, good supermarkets, etc., etc. Her place is about a 10-minute walk to the Finsbury Park tube stop, and there are also several buses that ply Stroud Green Road. The Piccadilly and Victoria tube lines that serve Finsbury Park are very dependable and come frequently. My only caveat is if you are unwilling to take 20- to 40-minute commutes to downtown London attractions and money is no object, you will prefer to stay downtown. But for anyone else, you will love your experience of living in a real, untouristy neighborhood and dealing with a generous, warm-hearted woman I'm happy to call a new friend."
13913,367568,40735,19835707,Mathias,Alina was a really good host. The flat is clean and tidy - and really close to Finsbury Park station which is quite close to Central London. I recommend Alina to everyone. 
13913,529579,40799,1110304,Kristin,Alina is an amazing host. She made me feel right at home. It was more like hanging out with a friend than a complete stranger. She's very sweet and makes a mean espresso. There are tons of places right around flat to eat and market is close in case you want to cook. I would definitely stay here again if I was in London. Thanks Alina you're awesome.
13913,595481,40819,1216358,Camilla,"Alina's place is so nice, the room is big and clean, and the bed is huge. Alina is a great host, and she made sure I had everything I needed, for instance she had put clean towels on the bed for me:) I felt very at home in her place. Aside from that she really helped me out with a lot of things, and even helped me find a permanent place to live in London. So overall a great place to stay with a great girl."
13913,612947,40825,490840,Jorik,"Nice location in Islington area, good for short business trip. House is OK, host is very friendly."
13913,4847959,41422,6405442,Vera,"I'm very happy to have been Alina's guest! We've had great time in London and enjoyed our stay. Alina is a great host, we felt us so welcomed by her! 
Alina's house location is very convenient, it's only 5 min walk to Finsbury Park tube station and also a direct (Picadilly) line to Heathrow Airport (in case yu have an early departure you can use the opportunity to sleep a bit in the train :) 
The flat itself is very nice and clean and comfortable, especially the double-bed with new mattress, I slept like a newborn :) And also the red sofa on the small roof terrace is great, I enjoyed the last night London sky!
To all who is going to visit London I highly reccomend Alina and her beautiful house to stay in. Alina, thank you so much and I hope to see you one day again!"
13913,8142329,41564,9195551,Honi,"I stayed with Alina in her flat in London for a week. It's a wonderful home with a warm feeling and everything you need. Alina went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and we shared some great chats and meals. I recommend Alina's place to anyone looking for a home for a while in London, and look forward to seeing Alina again. "
13913,11876590,41746,5194009,Alessandro,"Alina was a perfect guest and her flat is absolutely wonderful. Highly recommended. 
"
13913,46669566,42259,42970248,Oleh,"Alina's flat is exceptional one.  
I have to say i have never been to such an atmospheric place like her flat.
Plenty of stunning art items around and all of these pictures and drawings are magnificent and inspirational.
The kitchen is AMAZING. Huge window,  very bright and cozy  furnished with great equipment.

I would highly recommend this flat, 
i have had numerous short term rent in rent
and this one is number one to me.

13913,64559033,42434,45337884,Mo,"The House is a piece of Art , there are beautiful portraits everywhere ,  so close to the tube station , on piccaddily and Victoria lines , the host alina is very friendly , welcoming , and polite person , highly recommended"
13913,196153582,43000,40946748,A,Was great base for my London visit and great support to update me about things to do. l felt very much welcome. Thanks again.
13913,261305314,43226,106481379,Daniel,"Alina was an amazing host, simply brilliant. Always available and kind, super kind! I miss our discussions in front of coffee or breakfast. Stay in touch!"
13913,262179591,43228,99110277,Philippe,The host canceled this reservation 53 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13913,277816069,43268,31960932,Belinda,Lovely relaxed place to stay. Very friendly and thoughtful host would definitely stay again. Very short walk from tube very safe and diverse area. Would definitely stay again and would recommend going to Bar Faltering Fullback for a drink in a local bar
13913,451955791,43597,58728173,Charles,"Alina's place is cosy, convenient, and full of eclectic artwork,  and furnishings made by herself personally. She met me at the door and instantly made me feel at home. Entrance is on a major road but the flat is set back so there is very little noise from the street."
13913,467269212,43626,2291517,Andrew,"Alina, was very quick to respond. Thoughtful and accommodating. Would definitely recommend."
13913,538005731,43737,7253695,Bart,Alina is an amazing host who welcomed me warmly and was always up for a talk. Her place is in a nice neighborhood with lots of great restaurants around.
13913,539957261,43740,45592945,John,Alina is a very relaxed and friendly host who made me completely welcome.  Whilst the room fronted the main road there was no noise and a comfortable bed made for a great night's sleep.  The location is great with so many bars and restaurants on the doorstep.
13913,543287825,43745,28531625,Philip,Felt at home - Alina is an excellent host - very friendly - makes you feel wanted not just tolerated - many thanks
13913,568976830,43794,38999586,Ania,"Alina’s place is great! It’s very stylish and cosy at the same time. She is a great host, quick at responding and very accommodating. I would definitely stay at Alina’s again."
13913,609079783,43883,336060662,Samuel,Outstanding host. Got along great.
15400,21032,40168,53815,Hailey,"We loved staying at Phillipa's place in Chelsea. The flat was lovely, and the neighborhood was great. Lots of fun shops, and close to two metro stops. We would love to stay there again!"
15400,109674,40453,148145,Garth,"A comfortable apartment conveniently located near shops, restaurants and tube stations. 
Philippa is a very helpful and friendly hostess. We would recommend her and her apartment to anyone.
Thank you Philippa for an enjoyable holiday."
15400,120941,40468,112795,Cédric,"I really enjoyed my week at Philippa's, the place is ideally situated in Chelsea, and she is a very kind host, I would definitely recommend that you stay there, I will again without any doubt. "
15400,192035,40606,308956,Rob,"I am a little late reviewing this but it is important to me that I do.  Look, the place is in a great location and the neighbor was very friendly.  The place was perfectly comfortable and Philippa gave a lot of helpful information prior to our arrival in England.

However, me and my girlfriend were robbed the second night we were there.  We went out to meet friends and by the time we got back, all of our valuables were taken (computers, iPods, camera equipment, jewelry, etc).  It was upon the arrival of the police that we learned two things:
1)  Rooms here are rented out very, very frequently.  There are always people in and out so it is very obvious that there are tourists coming in and out of here.
2) The locks, as explained by the police, are very inadequate at this location and can be circumvented with extremely simple tactics.

The most aggravating part of this was how we were treated.  We followed all instructions exactly as they were laid out and were very deliberate in making sure everything was perfectly secure as we went in and out of the place.  However, all correspondence with Philippa (through email or through her neighbor) indicated nothing other than it somehow being our fault.  There was very little sympathy and all the commentary centered around what WE did.  Additionally, Philippa basically just stopped replying to emails after we expressed how frustrated we were from her responses and the lack of security and safety in the building.

So, it is a nice place and a convenient location, but the threat of robbery (or God forbid attacks) is just simply too high here."
15400,219843,40640,427875,Maria,"Very nice flat, and extremely well-located. Great for couples and single travelers. It is small and notes in the lobby indicate that the neighbors don't take kindly to noise--if you are a large family or group, this is probably not the place for you.

Philippa herself was a great host--I very much enjoyed meeting her. She left a great selection of helpful tourist info. "
15400,229267,40650,472341,Lisa,"This is a superior option to staying at a hotel in London, especially when considering the price of London hotels.  

The place is located in lovely Chelsea, seconds away from scores of shops, restaurants and pubs.  There is also a supermarket and cinema literally right around the corner.  If your only in London a few days and are primarily sight-seeing, the place is within walking distance to two metro stations and two or three tube stops to Westminister, Soho and Southbank  (about 20 mins total time).   A really great option for quick and easy access to central London with a quieter, trendy and less tourist neighbourhood to come home too.  And for anyone traveling from North America, London public transit is an absolute dream in comparison.

The apartment itself is very cute, perfectly clean and very well out-fitted.  Everything was recieved exactly as promised in the ad.  Phillipa was a kind and helpful host.  We would definitely recommend this place.  Great visit!"
15400,242805,40660,505370,Lorena,"Within less than 10 minutes of South Kensington and 15 minutes of Sloane Square tube stations, there are several buses even closest to the apartment such as line 14, 19 and 11 (if I remember well). Some of the buses run all night so if you want to go out and are a little low on money for the cab you can always take one f them to go home!
It is ideal if you want to do some sightseeing and party in London while living in a nice and calm area. Of course you'll have to be very quiet while coming back home because it is a residential area and that's what make it so nice. 
Lovely shop stores around on King's road, the Saatchi gallery is at 10 minutes walking, the grocery store is literally  around the corner.
Saint-Pancras station for those who take the Eurostar is in the same tube station at 45 minutes top. Most of the tourist spots are within 20 minutes.

The apartment itself is very quiet at night a little less in the morning because it is located next to a store delivery parking. No worries then close the windows turn on the air conditioner or put some ear plugs if you are like me (light sleeper) it only lasts an hour.

It is exactly as indicated in the add. Beautiful natural light that makes it very bright. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom with fresh towels and toilet paper (seems silly to point it but very useful when you arrive late and haven't got time to go to the market) and an equipped kitchen. Everything you need for your stay as a true Londoner!

Philippa is a very lovely and warm lady. I am sure she will make your stay as comfortable as ours. 
I am glad I've met her and I hope next time I'll go to London her appartment will be free for me to rent it! 

Thank you again for everything Philippa!! :) "
15400,458003,40774,565629,Lim,"Wonderful location! 10min stroll to the tube and as we found out, fantastic bus connections to lots of sightseeing spots of London. 
Having a well equipped kitchen and waitrose supermarket next door helps to whip up a good meal in pricy London. 
Apartment is clean and cozy. 
Philippa is very helpful and very welcoming. 
Highly recommend her apartment to all visitors looking to enjoy London for short and long stays. "
15400,488228,40785,928894,Jennifer,"Located in a convenient and central area of London, this flat is the perfect place for tourists looking for an affordable home base. Close to 2 tube stops and several bus lines, the flat is close to great shops and in a nice residential area. You'll have to be respectful of your neighbors if coming in late at night or early in the morning but it also means a peaceful time for yourself. The amenities and apartment are just as the photos and description indicate. The host is very helpful and accommodating. I'd love to stay here again on a return trip to London! "
15400,528262,40799,969713,Valerie,"Delightful, charming hostess.  Very clean, and wonderful neighborhood.  Only one bus to the city, lots of amenities nearby, very safe area, great pubs nearby, went for evening walks, great coffee shop in the morning....Thanks Philippa!"
15400,553595,40807,859564,S M,"The flat is exactly as it is shown in the photographs.
My flight in was very late; but Philippa was there to meet me at the flat; and seems a very good hostess.
As I was traveling alone, it was nice to know that she lives nearby for added security.
The building is quite secure, and the flat itself has very good locks; and also locking windows with a little separate key.
Even being on the ground floor, I felt very safe there.
I didn't mind the street noise at all, as we live on a busy street at home.
The bedroom has lovely thick curtains, so you can get a great sleep in the very comfy bed ,and not be woken up by light in the mornings.
The flat is spotless throughout, and has lots of hot water for showers.
It's got absolutely everything you would need; from hairdryer to iron, to all the kitchen equipment needed for cooking.
It's really easy to get around London from there : 
I recommend buying an Oyster Transport pass for the Tube and buses. 
I was even able to use it on a couple of regular trains.
Lots of great shops right nearby, including a wonderful large grocery store.
This was my first experience with AirBnB, though I always rent apartments when I travel;  and I was VERY pleased with it all.
Thanks, Philippa ;  for sharing your cosy home with others!
I would love to stay there on another visit!
"
15400,635891,40833,196656,Virginia,"Philippa is a wonderful host and a most charming woman - the apartment was lovely, the location perfect, the stay was completely hassle and problem free and I look forward to returning as soon as I can."
15400,680472,40848,495545,Alessia,"My parents came to London and needed a place to stay. I booked Philippa's apartment because I loved the position and the pictures on Airbnb. 
I arrived a day before my parents and went to Philippa to do the check in. She was amazing! So kind! 
The flat was super clean and tidy and very welcoming. I loved it at first glance!
I recommend the flat because has an extraordinary position ( it's in the heart of Chelsea, in Kings road!!!) and Philippa is an amazing host.
I definitely will rent again the flat in future!"
15400,864326,40924,583352,Carollyn,this is a wonderful little bolt hole in the lovely area of Chelsea - very conveniently located near Kings Road and lots of public transport. Highly recommended for short or medium stays. Thanks Phillipa.
15400,1027529,40989,1767934,Melanie,"I enjoyed my stay at Phillipa's apartment.  It was within easy walking distance to the underground station and was in an attractive and upmarket part of London.  It was a bonus having Waitrose supermarket in the next street.  Although I didn't get to meet Phillipa ( she was overseas) I had regular contact with her and she was concerned that I had a pleasant stay and everything I needed.  I would recommend  the apartment for both a long or short term stay in London. 
Melanie Brown"
15400,1064020,40999,1775383,Brando,"We had a wonderful stay in Philippa's apartment. Comfortable, quiet and very clean. The aparment is in a very nice location with all types of restaurants and a Waitrose supermarket right around the corner. In a few minutes you can walk to the river, over the bridge and into Battersea park! 

I didn't get a chance to meet Philippa in person as she was abroad, but she was very friendly and helpful over the phone and via email. We had everything we needed and it was a real pleasure to stay there. Thank you Philippa! "
15400,1354646,41056,1262848,Tony,"As a solo mature aged traveller wanting to spend some time in London, it was perfect. location  as  it is a short walk (about 12 mins) to South Kensington underground which gives you access to 3 main train lines Piccadilly, District and (Website hidden by Airbnb) is also just of Kings Roads in Chelsea giving you access to everything you need for your stay in London including supermarkets,eateries, post office and a great pub around the corner called the Builders Arms. Everything for me was perfect in the apartment. Nothing was not available that I needed. Philippa is a wonderful host and had prepared the apartment ready for easy access. Everything was explained and all easy to use. I felt very secure in the apartment which is very light and airy. For me it was my perfect choice for my stay in London, made even more enjoyable in having Philippa as your host who certainly has a great apartment for one or 2 people. Many thanks. Philippa as greatly appreciate the opportunity of staying in your Chelsea pad. It is perfect"
15400,1491714,41076,2384243,José Henrique,"We've been traveling to 
london every year, it was our first time in Philippa's flat and it was great. Everything is perfect and the location.... We loved! Thank you Philippa!!"
15400,1613474,41092,215772,Jason,"Very nice flat  with a lot of amenities, and it's very quiet! I stayed here for a couple of days this summer and would definitely stay again. 

Philippa was a bit hard to reach via phone / email at times, but I think I just caught her while she was doing some heavy traveling. Overall the trip worked out well and both she and Mary (a local tenant) were quite accommodating! "
15400,1718338,41106,2387745,Silvia,"El departamento esta muy bien ubicado y equipado.
La persona que nos recibio, fue muy amable en indicarnos donde ir a comprar comida en el horario que llegamos. Y Philipa nos permitio dejar nuestras valijas mas tarde del horario de salida.
Tiene un gran defecto que es el ruido de camiones en la semana, muy temprano por la mañana, ya que hay un negocio de muebles a la vuelta y los camiones estacionan justo en la calle a la que da la habitacion y hacen mucho ruido.
El sillon cama no es muy comodo para descansar.
Me resulto algo incomodo que Philippa llegue al departamento sin aviso previo, y que revise todo, nunca me paso algo asi, no se si es algo comun en Londres, pero he alquilado mas departamentos en otras ciudades, y eso me resulto algo molesto y extraño."
15400,1789153,41114,382420,Ruth,"What a wonderful first time London experience! From the very beginning Philippa, our host, was informative, helpful and open. Philippa was unable to meet us but Mary her friend and neighbor helped us settle iin and offered us umbrellas for our rainy stay.

The apartment was wonderfully located with a supermarket, pastry shops and so many restaurants within walking distance, ie just around the corner. Ditto for public transportation - bus stop just around the corner that served us as ""tour"" buses since the routes went by every known site you could wish to visit. Within walking distance the Victoria and Albert museum and the Natural history musuem, the beautiful church of St. Luke with its gardens just at the end of the street.

And the apartment itself was incredibly comfortable, with a washing machine and dishwasher and enough kitchen utensils for breakfast or any other meal you would want to prepare.

The neighborhood was exceptionally  quiet  in the evening with only the routine morning noise of the city of London waking in the morning.

I recommend Philippa and her home  very highly and hope to return quite soon.

Ruth"
15400,2140878,41151,164949,Carla,"Thank you for letting us stay in your beautiful flat. The location was excellent; you can almost see the bus stop from the front door! There is also plenty of shopping close by. The only tiny complaint we had was that apartment was on the first floor and it could be a little loud in the mornings. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. But I would definitely recommend this place!"
15400,2228512,41160,2664072,Katherine,"Just as pictured - tidy, comfortable and quiet, with a nice bathroom, a well stocked kitchen, and a washer/dryer/ironing board/iron which is wonderful if you opt to stay a full week or more. With a Waitrose and an M&S both just around the corner, you'll be all set!

It's an incredibly convenient location - just off King's Road, only 10 min. walk to the South Kensington stop (near the V&A and within walking distance of Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park, etc.) and ~10-15 min. walk to Sloan Square.  Philippa was also an excellent host, always very helpful and responsive.

We only wish we'd been able to stay another week. A wonderful value, and I'm sure we'll try to stay again the next time we're in London!"
15400,2298601,41168,2603702,Deva,"The apartment was lovely and exactly as promised. We found the location excellent -- convenient to bus and tube, with lots of shops nearby-- and all the appliances and furnishings excellent. Phillipa made checking in and out a breeze, and kindly left us some milk in the fridge, and made certain we understood how everything worked.

The only drawbacks are things the owner really couldn't control: the noise from the trucks unloading right outside in the mornings (not too bad with windows closed), and the resulting lack of air circulation at night. 

I would certainly recommend this flat to a couple looking for a clean, comfortable, well-equipped rental at a great price and in a great location!"
15400,2425906,41179,733596,LaValle,"The Bright Chelsea Apartment was just that. The flat is exactly as advertised ~ compact yet complete with everything you might need. Both of us arrived from Amsterdam a day into head colds. Philippa was kind enough to direct us to the ""electric fire"" she keeps tucked away so we were able to be a bit warmer on our sickest day.

Philippa is a great host making certain we knew where everything was and how it operated in the flat. We enjoyed being on the ground level for a change. Usually our accommodations  away from home seem to be on the fifth and sixth floors without lifts.

Philippa will be starting a remodeling soon so it wil be interesting to stay when she has completed that to see the changes. They undoubtedly will be stunning.

Special note: I needed to fax a document back to the States and asked Philippa about businesses that provided those such as FedEx and MailBoxes Etc. There is a MBE near the South Kensington Underground however Philippa advised that her printer should do that (wouldn't connect for me as a scanner but worked fine as a copier/printer). The alternative were free services at the Town Hall across Kings Road. I ended up at the library at that building. William helped me join the library and then made an appointment for me at the computer station that would scan my document so I could send it as an attachment to an email.

"
15400,3290846,41280,1457643,Alexander,"Philippa was a very friendly, warm and caring host. We arrived very early - which meant that the guest before us was still in the flat, so Pilippa showed as a nice British bar/restaurant and had (very early ;) ) lunch with us - thanks for that! :) The room was very clean, big enough for the two of us and very easy to reach via bus and metro. You need about 20 minutes by bus and about 10 minutes by metro to get to the center. 

We can only recommend this flat as accommodation and Philippa as a host!"
15400,3679074,41336,3726941,Natalie,"Philippa's flat in Chelsea is absolutely adorable. It is warm, cosy, welcoming, and simply a delightful space. In a marvellous location; a secure building;  I had a most enjoyable stay. Thank you so much!"

Great location in Chelsea! We had no problem getting the key. We had a great time and would be very likely to recommend this flat.

15400,8175572,41566,1631583,Brad,A wonderful location. Philippa's home has everything you need & is very comfortable...feels like home. Thanks again.
15400,8539696,41582,9500288,Tom,"Our first and very positive airbnb experience. The apt. was exactly as pictured on airbnb. No surprises and no disappointments. On arrival was clean and tidy. Key exchange went smoothly. Cozy but plenty of space for two people. Everything worked. WiFi was excellent.Communication via email with Phillipa was effortless. Location is great with easy access to stores, restaurants, buses and  underground. Neighborhood was quiet and safe. Highly recommended. Would definitely stay there again."
15400,8967459,41607,9235247,Dorothy B,"Wonderful location just off the Kings Rd. The flat was spotless, nicely decorated, good internet, comfy bed, plenty of hot water,small, but very well equipped kitchen. Good ground floor location so no need to lug luggage up stairs for us elderly folk. Philippa was a great host- answered all my questions promptly. Hope to stay there again."
15400,9561117,41641,10536261,Alison,We had a very comfortable stay in Chelsea Manor Street. Close to transport and all the things we wanted to do. Really nice to feel that we were at home. Philippa was overseas when we were there but arranged key pickup and answered our questions promptly. 
15400,9854993,41653,10602959,Vasily,It was a great two week spend at the place. Great location and everything you need to fell boom away from home.
15400,9925873,41659,4293299,Vera,"Lovely apartment, great location, clean. Nice area, King's Road round the corner. 2 Minutes to busstop. Hardly any traffic in the street. Some noise early in the morning (Waitrose is very near), but it would be difficult to find a more quiet place so central in London. Good communication with Philippa."
15400,12109023,41752,3918812,Rachel,"This Chelsea apartment is a great place for visiting London. It is perfectly located, with King's Road shops around the corner, buses going in all directions, and half way between two tube stations.
The apartment is sunny and cosy and very easy to live in.
Philippa is just an email away. It is a secure building.
We toured all over London from here."
15400,13308190,41784,13367361,Louise,"First time on Airbnb,

Philippa was very kind, welcoming and accomodating.
The flat is lovely, and as clean and quiet as said in the comments.
The location was perfect, next to underground station on the main lines.

We had there a wonderful time, and would be happy to stay there again !"
15400,13700395,41792,15528928,Gary,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I can only hope that future rentals are this positive. 

Excellent apartment and exactly as described in the listing, down to the nice pub around the corner and the very relaxing gardens at St. Luke's. Safe, vibrant neighborhood and the location can't be beat. Bus stops right around the corner, underground stations a 3 minute bus ride or 10 minute walk away. Full service market also right around the corner. Several eating choices within a short walk.  The apartment was warm and cozy and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. 

Philippa was an outstanding host. Once we booked she provided us a wealth of information on the apartment and the neighborhood to get us orientated and despite the late hour of our arrival she was there to meet us and get us settled. The apartment has internet and Philippa had a number of maps and guides to help plan our London vacation. If relaxing with a good book is on the agenda, she has a nice assortment to choose from. 

All-in-all a five star experience. I would not hesitate to recommend Philippa's apartment to my friends.

15400,14921686,41819,16199237,Robert,"This was our first BnB experience and we were very pleased.  The apartment was clean and comfortable and the owner was very friendly and helpful.  A delightful lady from upstairs made our stay more enjoyable and managed a maintenance issue while we were out.  Location was excellent, directly on the bus lines and short walks to two tube stations.  Many food/pub choices minutes away and the Waitrose market was just around the corner.  We felt totally comfortable with the neighborhood and although we were on a first floor, it was actually very quiet and we slept well.  Starts to get a little noisy some mornings at 8, but we were well on on way to heading out for the morning.  We appreciated the absolute absence of smoke in the apartment.  I can easily recommend this apartment and location to anyone!"
15400,15264060,41826,11959525,Michael,"Philippa’s little apartment was perfect for my week’s stay in London. Very well located and very accessible to public transport, pubs and restaurants. All amenities were readily at hand. If only I had realised that there was an air conditioning unit above front door before my last days stay, especially as London probably experienced its hottest days of the summer during my stay! I would certainly recommend this apartment and hope to stay there on my next London trip. Mike"
15400,17088763,41858,12970089,Andrew,A small flat off the Kings Road in Chelsea which we took for a month.  Probably a bit small for a full month (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes walk from Sloane Square it is a good position save for one glaring fault.  It is on the corner of Hemus Place (see (Hidden by Airbnb) street view) which contains the loading docks and delivery areas for Habitat and Waitrose and the trucks can start form 6:00 AM some mornings and 7:00 AM most!  A sleep in is not an option. A minor but inconvenient matter was the dish washer was non functional when we arrived and as the owner was overseas nothing could be done.    Generally satisfactory!
15400,23566366,41978,2984861,Roy,"A wonderful place to stay in London! It was easy to get to anywhere in London, situated between South Kensington and Sloane Square Tube stops. The first day we walked from the apartment to Westminister Abbey and Parliament. We loved the area, the walk along Kings Rd was one we did often and will miss. The flat was well appointed and Philippa gave us a thorough introduction to everything in the apartment before she left. Great food stores nearby, Waitrose and M&S.  If we go back to London we would want to stay here again. "
15400,27598311,42071,6608797,Shannon,"Philippa is a lovely hostess and very accommodating. The flat was just as described, and was perfect for my 2-week venture in London. Philippa's flat is very comfortable and private, and close to all amenities. I would definitely recommend it as a great place to stay while exploring London. "
15400,28046390,42079,102375,Andrew,"Nice friendly welcome from Philippa, great compact flat in good location."
15400,29497446,42102,28190119,Henry,"As previously arranged, we contacted Philippa when we arrived at the neighborhood Tube Station in London, and then met her in person at her flat just a few minutes later. She gave us a very thorough introduction to all aspects such as Kitchen, laundry, garbage, etc and welcomed any questions that we had. The flat and location were exactly as described in the listing, and, in fact, exceeded it.  "
15400,32758978,42145,7318364,Maria,Great flat and perfectly placed! Philippa was wonderful and explained everything in detail. We felt very welcome and safe there.

15400,34331228,42162,7002325,Katherine,"This is a perfect location for museums the V and A and the Natural History Museum. The 211 bus got me to Victoria Station in minutes; everything I needed close by - truly a comfortable, safe and pleasant venue for my solo city break. "
15400,35608823,42175,22851074,Michael,"Phillipa's apartment is clean, comfortable, well equipped, filled with natural light, and very well located. Very suitable for 1 person or a couple. As other reviewers have noted, it is behind the loading docks of two shops BUT double glazed windows throughout and heavy curtains in the bedroom minimised noise and light, with no problem for me on a morning I wished to sleep in. With a fan in the bedroom, air conditioning in the central hall and heating throughout, this would be a comfortable choice in any season. Ground floor location gives it convenient access with the Kings Rd - and buses - within 2 min. walk and tube within 12 min walk. "
15400,36030481,42179,4534043,Karah,Philippa's apartment was wonderful!! It was cozy and charming and in the best location. Communication with her was perfect and we found the place easily. She provided detailed instructions for everything in the apartment. We felt very at home. 
15400,37766478,42195,4443388,Udatta,"We booked the flat for 4 days in early July. Communication with Phillipa was excellent prior to our arrival. Unfortunately, we did not meet either Phillipa or any other person during our stay. Fortunately, we were able to get to the keys and successfully enter the apartment. The apartment itself was nice and comfortable. The location has its good and bad points. First the good - because of its location near a lot of nice shopping and restaurants (including a supermarket, Waitrose, nearby) our stay was comfortable. The number 11 bus which stops nearby takes you to within 15 minutes walking of most major sights. The bad thing about the location is it is right behind the Waitrose. ON our first morning we were woken up early by a lot of delivery truck noise. The dumpsters nearby are also a bit of an eyesore. But we kept the curtains drawn and were out most of the day so those things were soon forgotten. Overall we were pleased with our stay. "
15400,38136941,42198,3321262,Beth Ann,"We had a wonderful stay at Philippa's cozy flat. It was perfectly located for our purposes, close to transportation, very comfortable, clean and easy to feel at home. 
In terms of what matters to us, the kitchen had what we needed, the shower was strong, the bed comfortable, and the AC worked well. 
Communication with Philippa was pleasant, instructions were clear, and Mary was very nice when we arrived later than expected due to tube strike. 
All in all, a terrific experience. We would definitely stay again and recommend highly to others. 
Thank you, Philippa!"
15400,39030382,42205,35433985,Kathleen,"Philippa was very responsive to all communication and very thorough in her descriptions about how everything worked. She was not in the country during our stay but it is pretty much a turn key operation and there was a neighbor who we could have contacted if necessary. The apartment is as pictured and described on the website. Great neighborhood with excellent shopping dining and lots of pubs and clubs. little bit of a walk to the subway, but there are buses, taxis and uber so we had no trouble getting around. The apartment has all of the conveniences you could need or want. Dishwasher, washer and dryer and Air conditioning unit and all worked flawlessly. We would definitely stay here again."
15400,40096686,42213,15031078,Tricia,Our stay of 6 days in London at Philippa's apartment was very successful. The Apartment was as advised and being just off Kings Road was ideal. We would definitely use it again.  
15400,66557008,42452,8657262,Kirsten,"I had an excellent stay in Philippa's flat. Although she was away when we arrived, she made arrangements for us to acquire the keys and receive a tour of the apartment. The flat is so cute, perfect for 1 or a couple.

The apartment is located in a lovely neighbourhood, with many excellent bars and restaurants as well as 2 underground stations within in walking distance. We had no issues getting around the city while staying based in Chelsea."
15400,69724613,42472,27385446,Andrew,"I stayed in Philippa's apartment for a week while in London on business. The apartment was perfect for me. It had everything I wanted, it was very clean and tidy, the shower was terrific, it was handy to public transport, it was on the ground floor but very safe and secure. I will certainly try to stay here the next time I am in London."
15400,76869648,42519,51941207,Kurt,The flat is amazing. Its close to the bus stop and just a minute walk to all the pubs. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who want to stay in Chelsea. 
15400,82154888,42547,4785780,Kelly,"Good communication prior to arrival and Phillipa was there to welcome us despite late plane. Our second stay at her apt. Great location close to two tube stations, restaurants, shopping and a grocery store around the corner if you want to cook. Fully equipped. Beautiful little church park at the end of the street. Great place from which to explore London. "
15400,88973916,42577,1444416,Melanie,"I cannot recommend this flat highly enough. It was lovely, clean, easy check-in and -out, excellent location; everything you could hope for. Honestly, stop your search and stay here. It's the perfect slice of London life and British hospitality provided by Philippa. "

15400,97704669,42610,20856348,Cristina,"I loved my 6-night stay at this adorable apartment! It's compact but just right for just one person. It was also an extremely convenient 2-minute walk to my office along with a variety of shops, restaurants, and pubs. The ground floor location was a bit strange at first, as I felt that people on the street could see me in the apartment, but it ended up not being an issue (just make sure to close the curtains when you need to). It also can get a little noisy, but my sleep wasn't very disturbed. Overall, a tremendous value for apartment quality and location."
15400,99131049,42616,59200541,Natalia Sol,"It was a very nice stay. The apartment is exactly as described and has everything you could possibly need. We didn't get to meet Philippa but we could communicate and arrange everything for our arrival and departure. The  shower pressure was really good, we had lots of towels and the kitchen was more than fully equiped. There's a supermarket just around the corner which is great. The street is a bit noisy sometimes early in the morning. We would definitely choose this apartment again if we visited London."
15400,101139155,42625,18263861,Sharlane,"You MUST stay here! I cannot recommend this place enough. Communication with Philippa before we arrived was great, and the instructions to get into the flat were simple and clear. After we arrived, we received a welcome e-mail from her, and although she was not in London at the time, we were able to reach out to her neighbour if we needed anything (which we did not). The flat had everything we needed, and was the perfect size for a couple. It was on the ground floor, which was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but we were able to close the curtains and felt very safe and secure in the building. 

Chelsea is a very posh area and we felt very safe, even when coming home at 1AM in the morning one night. It is close to so many restaurants, great shopping, and is a 10 minute walk from the tube. It was also a great home base for sightseeing - we frequently only had to take one line (Circle/District) to get where we needed to go. 

I would definitely stay here again."
15400,101988349,42629,91648685,Mike,"A wonderful find, just off the King's Road. Compact but with everything that you possibly want and more. What's more, the host kept in touch to the extent that she was mid Atlantic when she became aware of the heat wave we were enjoying and e-mailed me to remind me of the air conditioning unit. Service indeed. Would I stay there again? Yes! Would I recommend it to friends? Ofcourse!"
15400,107551873,42653,36253984,Carmel,"We knew the area well, so knew how convenient the location is. Everything at your fingertips. 
There was a bit of noise during the day with local construction, but we were out most of the day so it wasn't an issue. The flat is small but cute, and had everything you would need. Highly recommend. "
15400,108051657,42657,92858307,Mary Lou,"What a great location! Super convenient, clean with a comfortable bed, luxurious linens and a super host. Our only regret is that we didn't get to meet Philippa as she was traveling- but she has a great system for check-in when she is traveling. We felt safe in the neighborhood and found a great breakfast place a few steps away... Nells. Tell them ""San Diego"" sent you!!"

Excelente ubicación, tranquilo y seguro."
15400,109863197,42666,35019564,Laurent Et Stéphanie,"Un superbe séjour : l'appartement est idéalement situé car  les bus passants à l'arrêt situé à quelques mètres desservent la station de métro de Sloan Square mais ont aussi un accès direct et rapide à Picadilly Circus, Victoria Station et bien d'autres lieux stratégiques. La station de métro Sloan Square étant sur la circle line est très pratique. King's Road est une rue commerçante animée, on peut manger dans des restos très sympas dans les environs proches. Le quartier chic est vraiment idéal.
L'appartement est très agréable, très coquet, la déco est jolie et la propreté est absolument impeccable. Philippa s'est montrée très réactive et prévenante dans ses messages, ainsi que de bons conseils. Elle ne nous a pas reçus à l'arrivée mais les explications étaient suffisantes pour que nous puissions nous installer confortablement. Une gentille attention nous attendait dans l'appartement. Tout a été vraiment parfait hormis un peu bruit la nuit et au petit matin (plaque de fer sur laquelle roulent les voitures à cause de travaux, service de livraison du magasin Habitat juste à coté, camions poubelles) dus au fait qu'on se situait au rdc, qui nous ont parfois réveillés. Néanmoins j'y retournerais avec plaisir et recommande grandement cet appartement. Merci Philippa. "

The location affords quick access to public transportation with a bus stop around the corner and the underground a short walk away. The apartment was cozy and warm for our stay in October. Philippa was easy to communicate with before and during our stay and left us with plenty of instructions and tips. We would stay here and highly recommend!
15400,239862634,43162,16945938,Inna,"This is a perfect flat for exploring London. Cosy, clean, close to the tube station, with many places for a substantial breakfast or a quick pint. Philippa is a super friendly and hospitable host. Out stay was great (including no problems with hot water which is not a rare thing in London and the heating inspite of the Beast from the East). A highly recommended place!"
15400,245006157,43179,158725324,Shelley,This was a great 1 bedroom flat with all the amenities of home. A short 8-10 minute walk to two tube stations as well as around the corner from the flat was a Waitrose market which has everything you need at great prices. The flat is located in a quiet area of Chelsea and a great place to come home to after sightseeing all day. I would stay here again in this Chelsea flat.
15400,248028439,43189,16702019,Robert,"Perfect stay! Excellent location with the bus stop within 30 sec, and the tube within a 10 min walk. Central but still very quite. Great and safe area. Very easy check in and very well equipped lovely apartment, clean. Thank you Philippa!"

15400,441942910,43577,138449721,Sarah,"We had a lovely and comfortable stay in Philippa’s flat. The location is great, we found several excellent restaurants nearby (favorites were Murials and the Ivy), and it’s a short walk to the Kensington Station. The flat is cozy and bright, it got a little warm with the windows closed but once you open a couple there are lovely breezes that cool it right down. The shower is amazing with fantastic water pressure! Philippa is very responsive to questions and never took more than a day to respond even while she is on her own vacation.  We traveled on our 1st anniversary and she left us a welcome card and an anniversary card also which was so sweet. Highly recommend!"

15400,506158053,43687,80916737,Rebecca,This was a perfect place to stay for 10 days while sightseeing in London. It was a little larger than I anticipated and was quite comfortable for two. The location is excellent — close to several bus lines and lots to do within walking distance. The construction was not very disruptive since it took place mostly when we were awake and out of the house. Overall an excellent experience. Just be sure to follow Philippa’s instructions rather than GPS in finding the address!
15400,518739648,43704,121806482,Маргарита,"Квартира очень уютная, небольшая, расположена в благополучном и красивом районе Челси. Состоит из небольшого коридора, спальни с кроватью шириной примерно 140-150 см. и объединённой гостиной с кухней, в обеих комнатах по два окна на разные стороны, они очень светлые. 
Автобусная остановка Chelsea Old Town Hall и большой супермаркет Waitrose, работающий с 7-30 до 22 часов, расположены в 5 минутах пешком. До станции метро прогулочным шагом минут 15. В 10 минутах пешком к центру на Кинг Роуд есть недорогие  места, чтобы перекусить - Pret A Manger и Itsu, да и вся улица представляет собой сплошные магазинчики. 
В квартире есть все, что может потребоваться во время проживания, включая посуду и кухонную утварь для приготовления различных блюд. Приятно, что есть капсульная кофемашина Нескафе Дольче Густо и тостер.
Wi-fi есть, работает нормально, также есть Нетфликс со всевозможными фильмами, мультфильмами и передачами (на английском, разумеется). 
Хозяйка, Филиппа, отвечает на любые вопросы через связь на сайте очень любезно, оперативно и подробно. 
Непосредственно рядом с домом идёт реконструкция здания, работы начинаются примерно с 7-30 в будни, заканчиваются достаточно рано, в выходные не работают. Мы в это время встаём, нам шум от стройки не мешал, но для кого-то может быть важно."

 Thanks to the owner of a beautiful house"
15400,619062614,43906,94988736,Michael & Julie,The location is excellent.  Shops and cafes  a block away. The flat is located in a quiet building on a quiet street.  There is construction going on next door but it did not bother us. It was very comfortable and a relaxing place to return at the end of a long day.  We would definitely stay again.
17402,204492,40623,348244,Edward,"Amazing location - great apartment, plenty of room for 4 - with space for more.  Well appointed rooms.  Easy to get to.  A great stay."

Clean, safe neighborhood with restaurants and pubs steps away.
A Tesco, Sainsbury and Pret a Manger are really close. 3 bds and 2 bthrm were enough to comfortably house 6 adults. Full kitchen, dish washer, and washing machine were a plus. No complaints. Would stay here again. Thanks Liz."

17402,593645,40819,1149659,Barry And Michelle,"The apartment was very clean, easy to use and was a great temporary home for us.  We stayed here for 9 days as we did some day trips out to various other cities across the UK.  The location is absolutely fabulous.  It is within walking distance of at least 5 different tube lines and two national rail stations, so day trips are super easy.  There are a host of restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, etc. in easy walking distance.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!"
17402,648636,40836,562216,Michael,"Liz was really great to accomodate our need for an apt. only ONE day before we were leaving for London.

The apt. is very cute.  Liz left really detailed information about the apt. and was available in case we needed anything.

We love the neighborhood (walking distance to Soho/West End) and it was perfect for our needs."

17402,1964976,41134,1447834,Wendy,"The apartment was in a great central location for the Olympics and very close to the underground and restaurants.  It was a clean (except for some silver fish in one of the bathrooms) and comfortable apartment.  I was not happy with the number of bathroom towels provided.  There were 5 of us so we were given 5 bath towels, 2 hand towels and no wash clothes.  We were there for 9 days and the washing machine broke early in our stay.  Our towels got a little ripe by the end or our stay. 

Liz was responsive when we emailed her, but I would have liked better communication on confirming our stay as it got closer.  We paid for the flat 6 months in advance because it was for the Olympics so I started to get worried when I did not hear from her.  I finally emailed her just over a week before we were to arrive to confirm our stay and find out how we were to access the flat.  When she responded, she confirmed the place but said nothing about accessing it.  Finally a day before we were to arrive she emailed the access info. 

Lastly, The second day we were there the washing/dryer machine jammed and would not open.  Liz sent someone out to fix it and told us it was a broken handle, but didn't let us know it wouldn't be fixed until after we were gone.  We found this out only after sending an inquiring email.  She never once talked with us about paying for the repair.  When we got home we received an email from an Airbnb mediator to pay for the repair.   Through Airbnb we came to a compromise and paid half of the repair though we did not break the handle.  Liz is responsive and nice, but often does not initiate communication when it would be appropriate and helpful.  "
17402,2463153,41183,2874775,Phil,"Overall, the stay here was pleasant and met all our needs for our time in London.  

Pros: 
Location is close to several tube stations making it easy to get around the city.
Lots of space where you can really spread out, bright with lots of windows.
Numerous restaurants and pubs nearby to get something to eat or drink.
Close to several grocery and pharmacy.
Liz provided a nice welcome guide with recommendations. 

Cons:
Several baby silverfish in the bathrooms.
Front bedroom facing the street can be very noisy at night with pub patrons on their way home. (back two bedrooms were quiet).
Keys and check in details were sufficient without a problem, but not provided until the day prior."

17402,10523344,41693,12085881,Marta,"I went with five more friends to Liz's apartment in Fitzroy Street. Surely, the best apartment i have ever been to. Firstly, Liz couldn't have been nicer to us!The flat was even better that in the pictures. Everything was great, (two bathrooms and 3 bedrooms). Location couldn't have been better. Everything was within walking distance(british museum, candem town, oxford circuss, pica dilly) or you could get the Warren Street Tube and you arrived everywhere in less than five minutes. The house was very near to Tesco Express and Salsbury Supermarkets, Pharmacies and everything you could ever head. Furthermore, the best night clubs in London (Libertine, Maddox and Cirque du Soire) were all a 15 minute walk. We stayed four days and we didn't have to pick any taxi!. The great majority of the Buses stopped in Tottenham Court Row(less than 3 minute walk from the house). 
I definitely recommend this house, as when we arrived, it couldn't be more clean. There was a dishwasher, washing machine, iron...everything you could need.
We didn't stay much on the flat as we went on a tourist trip, but it was extremely pleasant arriving to the flat,as it was great located and beds were extremely confortable.
I wont regret staying again in Liz's apartment!"

The apartment was clean, quiet and well-equipped. Only the noise in the street during the night was a little annoying.
Liz is very attentive to her guests.
I definitely recommend this apartment.

17402,25687272,42027,23242286,Cam,"The flat is well located, a short walk to two tubes stations (Victoria line and Northern line). There is good informational material sent in advance to help with arrival, and good reference material in the flat.
One downside of being well located is that the flat tends to be very noisy at night. Directly across the street is a 140 room LSE student residence, and with a student pub on the street corner, there is a lot of activity directly below the flat between the pub and the residence. We stayed for seven nights, and basically every night was very noisy until late.
This three bedroom flat would be a decent place to stay for the money except for one thing - two of the three beds have extremely poor quality mattresses. Before renting the flat, I specifically asked Liz about the mattress quality, and she assured me that the mattresses were of good quality. Well this was unfortunately for me and my family a blatant misrepresentation. One bed has a decent double mattress. The other two beds have really really bad mattresses, the kind where the springs are to the surface and little or no support or padding. To make matters worse, one of the beds has broken slats, so you sort of ooze downward in the middle. I reported this after our first (sleepless) night, and Liz's partner Jack came over to the flat. I showed him the two bad mattresses, and he seemed surprised at how bad they were, said he agreed that they were not of acceptable quality, and that he'd try to get them replaced immediately, but given it was a Saturday he said in all likelihood we wouldn't get new mattresses delivered until Monday. I said that was ok, and I appreciated his honesty about how bad the mattresses were, and his willingness to deal with the situation. Well, on Monday no mattresses arrived, nor any message from Jack or Liz about a change of plans. After two of my emails went unanswered, Liz finally answered to say that the existing mattresses were actually fine (!), that she's slept in the flat many times and that she's never had complaints before!!!! She didn't bother explaining how Jack could have been so wrong in his assessment. She had the nerve to tell me ""different beds suit different people I guess"". If the two mattresses were not of throw-away quality, why would Jack suggest replacing them immediately if they were not crappy?? The reason i'm making a big deal of this, as I've told Liz, is that the ONLY question I had of Liz before renting the flat was whether the mattresses were of decent quality.  She misrepresented the facts, and then despite her partner Jack agreeing with me, she would not admit she had lied to me. So buyer beware of what Liz has to say! I would suggest looking elsewhere. "
17402,25855435,42031,22523302,Hasan,The apartment was lovely and in a perfect location near great places to eat and famous streets of London and landmarks as well so its great for exploring the city. The hosts were so helpful and even made sure to fix the lights in the living room that were damaged by a previous guest before we even got there. They also provided a helpful info pack about London which was great for exploring. I would definitely recommend the apartment and the hosts to other people and hope I can use the apartment again another time.

Liz is very responsive and helpful in answering all my questions and giving all the informations I need to know, especially for check in and check out. We love the location, very close to restaurants and groceries as well as the tube station. All can be reached by walking distance in a couple blocks aways. The apartment is very clean and new, just as shown in pictures in airbnb. Check in and check out were super easy. Liz sent me the instructions for both in advance. The only one reason is just the water is very long to get warm and low water pressure in shower. Aside from that the apartment is just perfect. Thank you again Liz for having us and being a great host. We can’t wait to go back London and stay at your place again."

There are three underground stations within 8 mins walk, which is very convenient. The apartment is located in the shadows of the BT Tower and in the stomping grounds of the College of London. I highly recommend the apartment, but if you are looking for a quaint neighborhood, you might look elsewhere. Good value."
17402,321762934,43354,123823749,Sherrie,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was very clean and had the perfect amount of space for our party of four adults. The showers had great water pressure and the linens were very nice. One of the best features was it’s central location, just a short walk to multiple tube stations. That made it easy to pop back in later in the evening to recharge phones, grab coats, etc. The building was quiet and got great light. Overall, a really great experience. The only thing we would change is how you get the keys to the place. It’s a little confusing, especially after a long day of travel. On the plus side, Liz was very helpful and answered our call immediately when we needed assistance retrieving the keys. We highly recommend and would stay here again."

Entire flat was really clean and nice but  out of 3 bed room, 1 is relatively smaller. The host Liz was very professional and provided all possible information well on time.
Only miss was laundry and maid services for daily cleaning was not there and we were asked to pay if we choose. If you are planning to stay for more than a day then pls be ready to keep house clean and before leaving also it was clearly instructed that flat needs to be handover in the aame condition. Which sometimes practically not possible as travellers are in hurry to checkout mostly.
Overall place was really peaceful and I would recommend for family stay anytime. Just compare the cost while booking.

True to the past reviews Grace has recieved, she is prompt in getting back in touch with you. In my case at 11.45pm so that we could be confirmed for the next evening.

She is a fantastic hostess with a home thats as warm as her. She welcomed us with open arms and an open heart and never made us feel like guests.

Grace was a pleasure... is every possible way. And I will recommend her hands down.

person. Our room was quite adequate and overlooked the garden. The neighborhood is a very interesting mix of Hasidic Jews and Asians.
Breakfast provisions were excellent-exotic yogurt flavors we cannot get in the U.S. Grace was kind enough to leave an umbrella at our door on a day that looked like it might rain and she served as our alarm clock one morning when we had to rise at 5:30AM. The closest tube is Brent Cross-a brisk 10 minute walk. We would highly recommend staying with Grace G.

There are bus stops and a great supermarket very near as well. After all, Grace is really nice and friendly, we had such a good time with her. Thanks, Grace!

That's just what we found at Grace's.  She has set up her house perfectly for visitors.  Each room has a separate lock. She stocks her fridge with toast, jam, coffee and tea.

Guests have full access to kitchen with complete cookery, washing machine and dinner/living space.  Grace's generosity in providing breakfast foods (eggs, cereal, cold cuts,breads, biscuits, coffee, teas) and beverages (every juice imaginable, bottled water, etc.) is way above and beyond the call.   Shopping, good and diverse ethnic restaurants, and public transit on tube and bus are all readily available. "

Being in a largely Jewish neighborhood, everything closes down on Friday nights for Sabbath, so remember to do any food shopping before closing. Grace is a very pleasant and personable host."
25123,202694,40621,121790,William,"Great place to stay, Grace is a generous host and is quite welcoming.  One plus for me, that is probably not relevant to many, but I'll mention it anyway:  this is a good place to stay for someone doing research in the British Library newspaper archives, 5 minutes to the tube, 5 minutes on the train and you're at the archives.  Even if you're going to the main British Library at St. Pancreas, this is good place.  Evenings are quiet, so you can get some work done, if you're so inclined."

She is a great host, friendly and nice, she provides her quests with all sorts of food: yougurts, cheese, ham, juice, water, milk etc. It's all well arranged. 
The place is super clean and well kept, I’m sure you’ll enjoy staying with Grace as much as I did. Believe me you won't be disappointed.

I can't say enough about her and her home. Grace was a very gracious, helpful host. Her home was cleaner and more comfortable than some hotel rooms I've been in. Her kitchen was always stocked with food for a self catered breakfast (which was really helpful when your a tourist and don't really want to waste time eating out for breakfast.) and it was always clean.

The room was a comfortable size with a comfortable bed and wifi. There is a shared bathroom, but even with the two other rooms in the house occupied, it wasn't a problem.

The location was perfect for us. It was a relly easy commute to central London. After sightseeing in the heart of London, it was nice to go back to the peace and quiet of a neighborhood.

We plan on making another visit to London early next year and we plan to stay with Grace again!!!!!"

Great location. We went jogging every morning near Hampstead which has a beautiful park and forest area. Cute shops and cafes at Hampstead also. We found great Lebanese and Turkish restaurants near Golders Green. We would love to stay here again when we return to the UK. Thanks Grace for being such a lovely host!"

25123,596321,40820,715462,Geraldine,"Grace is a most excellent host! She is very friendly and easy to talk to and more than willing to help. Every time we see her, she's always smiling and happy! It was really nice to chat to her. We felt really at home.

The room is clean and spacious. We stayed for more than 2 weeks and she offered to change our bedsheets after a week or so which was really nice! 

The location is just a short distance away from Brent Cross station and Golder's Green. It is a quiet Jewish neighbourhood and very safe at night. There are plenty of grocery shops and places to eat at Golder's Green so not to worry. Both stations are on the northern line which doesn't seem to get much delays or disruptions which is good. It's easy to get to zone 1 too.. just abit long. 

We used her kitchen and her washing machine with no problems. And stayed up to watch tv all night. I hope we weren't too noisy! haha.

I would definitely recommend Grace's place to anyone.

This was our first time staying with airbnb and it was a great experience. We even had a nice time chatting with another traveller staying there who came from South Africa. 

I will definitely be doing this again. :)"

25123,3547893,41320,3784440,Stephanie,"We stayed at Grace’s home for two nights. She and her boyfriend are very nice. They were helpful, arranging a taxi for us. Grace’s house is perfectly clean, it can’t be any better. The house and our room was tastefully furnished, but without any odds and ends. You share the bathroom with the host and other guests, but that was no problem at all and everything perfectly in shape. A wide range of food is provided for breakfast (different juices, jams, cereals, etc.), everything fresh and appetizingly. The house is quite and in a good neighbourhood, a few minutes from tube station Brent Cross. We had a wonderful time and I totally recommend staying here!"
25123,3704697,41338,5252831,Natasha,"I enjoyed my stay at Grace's very much! Nice and quiet location, very friendly and welcoming hosts, very clean house. Everything was perfect! Will stay there next time I'm in London. Thank you Grace! "
25123,3810295,41350,5353467,Joana,"We had a wonderful time at Grace’s house!
The room is really big and very comfortable, as well as the rest of the house.
Everything was perfectly clean (and I must say I am very picky on this!) and the inside temperature was great, despite the cold that was in the street.
The breakfast includes a variety of juices, yogurts, milk, teas, bread, cereals, jams, …  and we were able to cook our dinners in Grace’s kitchen, which was fully equipped.
The tube station is just in a few minutes walking distance and the neighborhood is nice and safe.
Grace is a wonderful person, really friendly and cheerful, and indicated us some interesting places to see in London. She even received us at a late hour, as our flight arrived only at 10 p.m.
We will most definitely come back and recommend it to everyone who is looking for a comfortable, quiet (but cheerful), clean house in London! 
Thank you Grace!"
25123,3840092,41352,2865139,Nicola,"My stay with Grace was perfekt! She lives in a small house in a typical british village area which was a great experience. Very quiet and good connection to the tube and also to Luton Airport.
The room was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was free to use and everything for breakfast (cereals, toast, tea,...) was already provided. Would come back anytime!"

25123,4882841,41424,4453506,Alan,"Grace was a wonderful Hostess!  Her place was immaculate, and probably one of the most comfortable accommodations I have ever stayed.  Location was a nice, quiet, and beautiful suburban neighborhood; walking distance to the train station.  There was an Early Morning/Late Night market near buy that had just about any necessity one could use during travel, (including power converters).  Thank You So much for your kindness and hospitality Ms. Grace!  =)  "
25123,4997929,41431,4159494,Elizabeth (Effy),Grace was a lovely host. Her charming house is located just a short hop from Brent Cross Station on the Northern Line in a quiet residential neighbourhood off Montpelier Rise and very convenient to a huge 24-hour Tesco for those midnight munchies :) My room was spacious and tastefully appointed. There was even breakfast provided. I would definitely recommend everyone to have a stay with Grace!
25123,5056705,41435,4532411,Xinyuan,Nice place and nice room. Very recommend you to live. 
25123,5165224,41441,6480083,James,"Grace was a fantastic host, striking the perfect balance between personal and professional. The room was spacious and comfortable with tasteful furniture. Grace's home is full of flourishing flora which is, in my opinion, the sign of a great homemaker! 
I only saw Grace twice—when I checked in and the morning I left—and didn't see or hear any of the other three guest who were staying and never had a problem accessing the bathroom in the morning. The fridge was always fully stocked with a variety of juices, bottled water, bread, milk, jams etc as well as load of cereals. My first Air B&B experience was great and I will definitely return when I am working in Hampstead in the future. Thanks Grace! X"
25123,5243918,41445,6173421,Jos,"A simple but very clean room. TV wasn´t working, but personally I don´t mind that.  Grace is a very friendly woman and sincerely interested. The breakfast is simple as wel, but ok. The rooms are very close (7 minutes walk) to the Bent Cross tube station, so that's a big pro. Personally, I liked the neighborhood. 

In my eyes there´s only one serious point for improvement. When lying on the bed I could feel the springs. They were not stabbing and pointy, but not comforting as wel... On the other side: I heard from many people that's a common problem in London, even in above average Hotels like Holiday In Express. 

The biggest pro's are the clean rooms and Grace, a very friendly host. 
The biggest minus regards the mattress of the bed. 

To come to a conclusion: I'll be happy to book a room at Grace's again."
25123,6709471,41508,7210059,Jill,"A good place to stay with easy access to Central London. Safe walk to train station, especially at night. Room was big, light, clean and comfortable, just as described. Grace was very helpful and easy to get on with with."

She gave me great advice regarding the surrounding area, nearby eateries , tube stations etc.
The fridge was always stocked with fruit juices that I love, bread and jam so breakfast was no problem.
Room is spacious and bed was great.
Wifi works well and Internet is very fast for those who need to do some work (I needed to).

25123,8259134,41569,8075678,Carol,"I picked Grace's home because of the great reviews I read prior to booking.  This was my first B n B experience and I was most impressed;  The home is in a convenient location, easy to get to the tubes.
Grace was more than helpful, she emailed me with valuable information before  I arrived.  Since this was my first time in London this information helped to ground me.
The home is spotless, organized and pleasant.  Grace goes out of her way to offer any assistance that is required.  I would definetly return and recommend this home.
Keep up the good work Grace, you deserve a lot of credit for your business sense and organizational skills.

25123,12235374,41756,11672955,Ruth,This was my first airbnb experience and a very positive one. I enjoyed my stay with Grace. She is a friendly and helpful host who has a bright and spotless home. There are a few home rules and these are clearly spelt out so there can be no confusion. As I have problems eating yeast she bought soda bread for my breakfast which was nice of her as there was also cereal available. I would certainly be happy to stay here again.

Dopo un primo momento di confusione in quelle strade tutte uguali, è davvero facile e veloce raggiungere tutto, anche il supermercato Tesco. La casa antica e caratteristica londinese è molto carina e ben curata e pulita. La colazione è abbondante e con molta scelta e la disponibilità di cucina e frigo ottima. Ci torneremo di sicuro."

25123,27253726,42064,20939808,Benjamin,"I stayed with Grace for six weeks while undertaking doctoral dissertation research in London. I have honestly never met an Airbnb host more willing to make you welcome and at home.  She is an amazing person: unfailingly kind, considerate, funny, smart, and caring. The room - even by my American standards - was enormous, with two full-size closets, dresser, desk, and shelving. The house is spotless, comfortable, and quiet. She provides a full suite of cooking appliances in her beautiful kitchen, and even includes breakfast in the Airbnb rate (a rarity these days). Grace deservedly expects you to keep her house clean and quiet - an easy task. I will definitely stay with her again, and I highly recommend her to any friend or colleague who wants a cozy place to stay while working or studying in London. "
25123,28847052,42093,266229,Richard,"Grace felt us welcomed to her house. The place is sparkling clean and it has everything that is needed to feel comfortable there. The area is quite safe, not trendy, but it is fairly close to anywhere where you can enjoy London.

Highly recommended."

I enjoyed my stay at Grace's and would definitely visit again."
25123,30039828,42110,30214828,Laura,"I arranged for my daughter to stay with Grace during her final weeks of college testing.  Everything about this experience, from initial contact to departure was friendly.  Grace  made her feel welcome the minute she walked into her lovely home.  The room was spacious and the rest of the house very clean and well maintained.  The neighborhood is great and completely accessible to much of London and I had no fears of my daughter being out during the evening hours.  I would totally rebook with Grace for my daughter (or any of us!) were I in need of a London accommodation.  She truly makes you feel more a part of a family than a guest who was simply renting a room!"

L'accès au centre de Londres est rapide, environ 10 minutes de marches jusqu'au métro et environ un quart d'heure jusqu'au centre. Très pratique.
Nous avons passés un excellent séjour et prêt à revenir si l'occasion se présente.

After a week of travelling we enjoyed being able to prepare dinner in her well equipped kitchen after shopping at the nearby supermarket. Felt right at home in the area again with its good transport and easy access to London sights. Grace is as previously a friendly and helpful host who makes you feel at home in her home. We look forward to returning very soon.

Even when we were early on arriving Grace carried all our luggage up the stairs whilst we went out shopping. She was so helpful in giving us tips on where to travel and provided all the necessities for our weeks stay. The place was tidy and our room was very spacious. The location is great as it's very close to a tube line and shopping centre. After staying with Grace we would definitely recommend her to our friends and family.

Auch die Sauberkeit im Zimmer war super, durch das Teilen des Badezimmers mit den anderen Gästen war die Sauberkeit im Bad manchmal nicht ganz gegeben, aber dafür kann Grace ja nichts. WLAN funktionierte super, die Lage war in Ordnung( ca. 10 Min. Laufweg bis zur nächsten Metrostation.) , das Preis-/Leistungs Verhältnis hat auf alle Fälle gestimmt. Positiv Hervorzuheben ist der gefüllte Kühlschrank( Wasser/Milch/O-Saft) für die Gäste! Vielen Dank an Grace!"

25123,343644903,43405,63448806,Marie,"I had a great time staying with Grace :) The house was in a safe area, it was very well equipped, everything was always clean and tidy and I felt very comfortable since the day I moved in . Grace is a very cool and lovely person and also a great housemate. I have nothing to complain about and I would absolutely recommend to visit London and stay with Grace."
25123,436141559,43567,171365324,David,"Grace has a wonderfully cosy Airbnb. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and had every necessary item that one needs. The shared facilities (kitchen, living room, bathroom..) were all clean and easy to use. There are plants everywhere in the Airbnb, which is very relaxing as it gave the impression of being in a yoga retreat centre. It was a lovely stay in London!"
25123,442426326,43578,237495225,Dalila,"Una experiencia hermosa, la casa era muy limpia y ordenada, grace es una anfitriona de maravilla, contabamos con cocina y lavarropas lo que hacia todo mas facil"
25123,445868274,43585,250811751,Adam,"Room, it's space and equipment is equal to prize. The equipment is simple, nothing too special about it. The house is lovely, shared space is well kept an Grace is the best host you can possibly ask for. Not only she is absolutely helpful in person, but she checks if everything is all right via messages. She is easy going and there is probably nothing that would disappoint you in her"
25123,477465242,43644,237634141,Michela,"I spent two months in this really nice apartment in the company of very nice and respectful people. A big thank you to Grace, she is a wonderful person and always very helpful. It was a great experience that I would recommend to those looking for cleanliness, tranquility and a very enjoyable stay. I spent great time and I will choice the apartment again in the future."
25123,538948899,43738,240844030,Stephan,Booking a room in Grace's house is a great deal.  Grace is very nice and she helps the guests wherever she can. The house is very clean and is situated in a quiet residental area. I would book this accommodation again at any time.
25123,545395591,43750,295453271,Calight,"Located in a safe and quiet residential area, Grace’s place is clean, neat, well-equipped and comfortable. There is no need to worry about supplies and transportation because a mega supermarket and a tube station are within walking distance. Besides, Grace is a friendly and accommodating host. :)"
25123,570762881,43799,6152847,Benjamin,"For me this really was an exceptionally pleasant stay, and I think it's because Grace takes great care of the house, has a warm personality, and is very kind to the people around her. I'll definitely return."
25123,577378693,43814,250784005,Julien,"Grace e uma excelente anfitriã, muito atenciosa, comunicativa, preocupada com seus hóspedes e nos dá muita liberdade dentro da casa, inclusive a chave. Tive uma ótima estadia. O apartamento é calmo, com energia positiva e super limpo. Volto lá com certeza e super indico."
25123,588338719,43834,225409357,Mateus,"Grace is an amazing person, very friendly, receptive, cheerful and always willing to help. 
The house is excellent and my room was very nice, just like the pictures. 
The accommodation is well cared for and very clean. It is near the subway station and the market. Thanks for the tips, the hospitality and the kindness, Grace. 
Highly recommend, grade 10."
25123,602019860,43866,40674786,Alizée,I really enjoyed my stay with Grace! The house is very nice and she gives good recommendations! Would recommend :)
25123,618512212,43905,6152847,Benjamin,"Grace is a phenomenal host - - thoughtful, caring, and kind. My second time staying here, and certainly not my last if I could help it! Would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking for a warm, welcoming home in London!"
33332,120040,40467,219483,Luigi,"The room is spacious and cozy, and the house is lovely.
It also has Wi-Fi high speed Internet connection.
There is a bus stop (H37) across the road, connecting to St Margarets railway station and to Richmond tube station (district line) in few minutes.
At walking distance there is a nice path along the river Thames, which brings to Richmond.
A convenience store is just few steps from the house, as a few other stores which I didn't try.
10 minutes walking on St Margarets you will find the Ailsa Tavern, a pub which serves good dinners, which I loved.
Chi-chi is a very discreet landlord, and I really suggest this accomodation.
By the way, Richmond really deserves a visit! Great place."
33332,173829,40566,346341,Tammie,"We stayed three nights and overall the bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and warm. However, Chi Chi herself was not so warm the first night. We were startled with an abrupt knock on the door at 12:30am from Chi Chi asking us if we had been in any of her private rooms, particularly her bathroom. She was concerned that we had been going in and out of rooms and felt the need to confront us in the middle of the night. She kept me up for 15 mins confronting and inquiring about when we were getting up, where we had been, etc. It was quite unpleasant considering that we had just arrived from Los Angeles and we were completely jet-lagged. The next morning she was more pleasant and from that point on we didn't see her again until we checked out on the third day. If you are looking for a place that only allows access to and from your room to your bathroom then this is the perfect place for you. It has wifi and heating, but no tv access and no kitchen access. There are signs posted ""private"" throughout the house, which doens't create a very welcoming vibe. If you don't mind someone waking you up in the middle of the night and inquiring about your plans and your whereabouts, then this place shouldn't be a problem for you. "
33332,291640506,43297,113253616,Rui,"It is very near stadium and we come here to watch concert, it need about 30 minutes to walk there. House is nice, you need to prepare shampoo and water by yourself. There is a shop near the corner."
33332,344950900,43408,31445026,Jason,"Clean, comfortable and as described. Couldn’t ask for more. Thanks"
33332,458711464,43611,250703568,Samantha,Great stay Chi-Chi was great about letting us check in early. I would stay again.
33332,615630871,43898,340042315,Darren,"Good area, accurate description, Chi chi is a friendly caring host and the facilities were useful."
36299,126573,40476,238713,Ray,This is a very nice house in a very nice neighborhood.  The five of us had an enjoyable weekend.  Kew Gardens is a bit out of town but no trouble to get to on the Underground.
36299,218177,40638,427486,James,"Lovely house, great location with convinient transport links.

Host provided us with some food and drink upon arrival and was very friendly, helpful and overall a joy to deal with.

Will definitely use again."
36299,231819,40652,443197,Jennifer,"This is a wonderful location. This house is in a lovely neighborhood, has a nearby train station,grocery stores,tow path along the Thames and is within walking distance to Kew Botanical Gardens. Geert was very helpful and made himself available to answer any questions we had regarding our trip. We highly recommend! "
36299,349094,40727,445777,Edwige,"We had a wonderful stay.  Geert was really nice and always available via email for any question we had.  We were ideally located with easy access to the Tube.  We loved the little ""village"" around the train station and enjoyed having breakfast outside in the garden!  The house was impeccable.  We definitely recommend it."
36299,360214,40732,590605,Bodil,"We were delighted with the house that Geert provided. Everything was very clean and the house was fully equipped. The beds were excellent and apart from the airplanes on their way to the airport it is a very quiet location. The proximity to the tube, buses, restaurants and shopping centre was perfect. We did not get a chance to meet with Geert but he stayed in touch throughout and we never felt abandoned. It is a perfect location for those who want to visit London but still get a ""real feel"" for the city and how people live there"
36299,480574,40783,573127,Ursula,"Definetely the best place to stay in London, especially if you love Kew Gardens as I do ! Going to the city is no problem, and after a long day of sightseeing relax in this nice neighbourhood. Great for running along the Thames!"
36299,831005,40911,635825,Panos,"We had an ideal stay at Geert's house. It is well located, outside the bustle of central London but only 5 minutes walk from the underground. The house is spacious, more than enough for us (a family of four). Geert was perfectly responsive; although we did not meet, everything was laid out for us in advance, and we never felt at a loss. Very organised and clean, a very pleasant experience."
36299,1233481,41035,1829820,Gina + Azeem,"We rented Geerts house for 5 days. We were lucky to be able to park the car right out front and I enjoyed my walks to the tube station through the pretty neighbourhood. It was a fine connection to get into central London and lovely to go back to a peaceful neighbourhood at the end of the day. I also found it super convenient that the Kew Retail Park with a Boots, Marks & Spencer, Mothercare, and clothing shops, was a short walk from the house.
The house it self had all the conveniences that we needed. We were staying there with 5 adults and a baby and all had a comfortable stay, and it was nice to be able to stay in a proper home and not a hotel. 
Geert was a very friendly host, he was reachable and provided a handy  booklet with information about how to get to the tube station, how things in the house worked, etc. This was our first time staying somewhere using airbnb and it was a great experience!"
36299,1355696,41056,1963701,Nancy,"We had a lovely four day stay. Kew is adorable and Geert was a great communicator from the moment we booked.  imaculate home, pleasant walk from the station, half an hour from central London attractions.  We wouldn't  hesitate to stay the again."
36299,1399080,41062,2065711,Amanda,"This house is a lovely place to stay for the location (close to the Thames River path, Kew village and London transport) and the comfortable accommodations. Back garden is a bonus for children, as well. Geert was extremely responsive to all of our questions and took great care to ensure we had a great stay. We hope to be back again before too long!"
36299,1424734,41066,285813,Nigel,Lovely place in a lovely area - highly recomended.
36299,1573514,41087,2085281,Dave,"Fantastic -- exceeded my (already high) expectations! :)  

What can I say -- everything was exceptional -- from all the email correspondence with Geert leading up to the trip, right through our departure. Geert played, not only, host for his place but as  host for London tourism -- supplying lots of information on how to get about, places, to eat, etc...  And an excellent ""things to know"" guide about his place -- how to work appliances, what to do in emergencies, where all the keys were, etc...

I, along with my family, had the pleasure of meeting Geert on our arrival and he made us feel like we were friends coming back for a visit rather than strangers showing up for the first time.

The house is great -- as is the location. Geert's recommendations for food were spot on. Well -- you get the gist and I'll just run out of glowing adjectives. :)

Thanks Geert!!"
36299,1946157,41132,661952,Steve,Geert was an excellent host and the house was just as described.  Fantastic experience for my family.
36299,2036260,41141,722790,Sarah,"Had a wonderful stay at Geert's house in Kew.

We hired the house for a base for my family to stay in over my wedding weekend in London - couldn't have asked for any better - beautiful place, lovely garden and perfect me to get ready in on the morning of my big day.

I would highly recommend this house to anyone wanting to explore the area.

Thanks Geert.

Sarah & family"
36299,2096955,41147,1630091,Maya,"Lovely house. Very close to Kew Gardens which are beautiful and great for small kids. Very easy access into central London.

 Can get a little noisy due to the airplanes and trains but anywhere in Kew would have the same issue."
36299,2603308,41196,2919605,Amber,"We loved our stay at Geert's place and he was immensely helpful with info as we travelled from Australia with our two boys.  We would definitely return to his lovely, perfectly located place. "
36299,2790912,41216,3281785,Bodil,We had an excellent time at Geert's house. Although we did not get to meet in person he was available to contact at all times and made us feel very welcome. The house is immaculate with comfy beds and good size bathroom and kitchen. Location is excellent with underground and bus only 10 mins walk from the house as well as easy access to the airport There is good shopping close by and the house is situated in a quiet street. I would really recommend staying here if you are visiting London!
36299,5574994,41462,4932933,Stephanie,"Geert's place was absolutely fantastic.  The location was within walking distance of the Tube, a post box for our postcards, a shopping center and the national archives.  The home was clean and fit our family of five perfectly.  The backyard was nice for us after a long, noisy, busy day in London.  The children enjoyed the backyard playground.  Geert was always quick to respond to e-mails or phone calls with any questions or concerns (we only had one after we arrived as Geert had provided us with maps, tube information, etc. so we didn't have any questions or concerns after we arrived).  I would stay here again and again.  Perfect!  "
36299,5862829,41475,2318477,Flaminia,"Our stay in Kew Gardens has been great! The location is excellent, very close to the tube station and the river. Wonderful walks along both the river banks! The house is really beautiful and comfortable. Geert is a perfect host, making you feel welcome and assisted. He kept in touch to be sure we were fine and answered readily our emails. Its info about the house and how to move around is perfectly clear and complete. He left us every kind of useful London guides and maps, and provided also essential breakfast. Lovely place to stay, all of us wish to be back in kew soon! Thank you very much, Flaminia & family"
36299,6803034,41512,4289057,John,"There were 5 adults in our party and we stayed at Geert's house for 9+ days in August 2013. The house is located on a quiet street and there was plenty of room for us. The beds were very comfortable. Geert's description and pictures are very accurate. There was no need for us to rent a vehicle. We used the Underground and Rail services to all our destinations. The Eastbound side of Kew Gardens Underground has a wonderful array of local stores that we found very convenient. There's a butcher, health food store, 2-3 restaurants, Starbucks, pub, barber, and so on. There are ""Retail Shops"" within a 5 minute walk of the house. All your food and basic needs are available within a 5 minute walk of the house. Also, Kew Gardens is really quite a beautiful area.

Should you decide to rent a vehicle, be aware that there is only parking on the road and it's very limited. Also, the house is on a flight path, so you will hear planes flying overhead. However, it didn't bother any of us at all.

Geert is very familiar with London and is able to provide you with directions and tips. Be sure to use his expertise. He speaks an number of languages fluently and is easy to communicate with. He is very helpful.

This was the first time we rented via airbnb.com and we had a very positive experience.

Thank you Geert."
36299,8532165,41582,9258374,Birgit,Geert is a very good host. The house was just perfect for our short stay over the weekend of Halloween. It is very beautiful and well kept and the location in Kew Gardens is very convenient.
36299,9535520,41641,7215716,Grant,"Such a lovely house - felt like home almost immediately.  The kitchen is fantastic and is well accommodated for cooks.  All the rooms  are large and comfortable and the house is perfect for a family. The location is great - close to the walking paths along the river, 10 minutes from the tube and train station and just around the corner from a great retail park with a large Marks & Spencers and Boots.  We also appreciated Geert's detailed instructions and responsiveness - he was incredibly helpful before and during our stay.  We are definitely going to stay there when we're next in London!

"
36299,12602097,41765,9299773,Mirjam,"We really had a great and comfortable stay at Geert's house in Kew. Whoever is interested to be in a more personal atmosphere than a hotel and to have a bit more space (especially with children), this is a place to recommend. The house is well equipped and in a good and nice area - close by the railway station, shops etc. Geert was really helpful right from the beginning of the communication. Even though we did not meet in person, he is a great host and very easy to deal with. Thanks a lot Geert! "
36299,14388817,41808,13275131,Dee," My first experience of Airbnb, and it was a great one. Geert replied immediately to our booking request and it was easy to set everything up. 
I took my 93 year old mum, who is very fit, but a hard task master when it comes to finding a comfortable bed. Geerts house passed with flying colour's!
The descriptions were accurate and Geert left a very detailed and accurate info pack in the house. 
Great for Kew Gardens and easy to get into town. Would defiantly go again."
36299,16342262,41846,14930200,Mary,Geert's home was as pictured. It was clean and very pleasant.  Our family felt safe and comfortable there.  I would not hesitate to recommend this listing.
36299,19788351,41900,20559298,Jean-Michel,"Great house, and the band had a very pleasant stay. Beautiful neighbourhood."
36299,22167676,41943,22774260,Lee,"Great place to stay for a family. House ideal for what we needed with two teenagers and a toddler. Great location - really safe and nice area with good local amenities - shops, restaurants, pubs - but also very easy access to public transport into Central London. Host Geert kept in contact throughout to ensure our stay went smoothly. Would stay here again. Have never used Airbnb before but experience has been infinitely better than using a hotel and being cooped up in a room for twice the price."
36299,23894723,41987,15647065,Leonie,Geert made us very welcome by leaving very clear instructions for absolutely everything we could possibly want to know about his home & the local area. He also left a much appreciated box of chocolates!  We soon found our way around the local area - including the beautiful Kew gardens. 
36299,24326442,41999,22991059,Tricia,"Geert was a fantastic host.  He was very accommodating on arrival and departure times.  He responded promptly to all of my questions.  He also provides a welcome packet that answered lots of my questions.  His home is also very cozy.  A few points to consider -- the street is very narrow if you are considering driving.  The house is also near a train track - which after a day or two I no longer noticed.  His descriptions of the size of rooms and beds is also accurate - some are small, but serve the purpose.  His photos are also accurate - the main sitting room consists of a couch and two chairs with no tv.  All this said - it is in a great location. Easy walk to Kew shops and train.  Quiet street and great neighborhood."
36299,24846640,42007,11488327,David,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and Geert made it an excellent one from start to finish.  We have a family with three young children, and it made all the difference in the world to stay in a quiet residential neighborhood on the edge of London rather than in a hotel.  It really felt like ""coming home"" every night, a much better experience for the family.  The property is very well kept, in a nice neighborhood just a short walk to the tube.  There are a few restaurants nearby in Kew Gardens, and we found a great variety of excellent places to eat in nearby Richmond (5 min or so by car, bus or train/tube).  

What really set things apart was how friendly and helpful Geert was throughout the process.  He was very responsive to messages and went above and beyond to offer lots of helpful advice to make our visit to London more enjoyable.  He provided a very useful ""house manual"" with practical advice on the house as well as public transport and local sights, along with a number of local pocket guidebooks that helped us daily as we planned our excursions with the kids.  Most notably, we encountered some unexpected maintenance closures on the tube during our visit and Geert emailed me back before the next morning with several detailed maps and suggestions for alternate ways to get too and from central London.  What could have been a major headache on our holiday was no problem thanks to Geert's timely and practical advice. 

If you do drive a car, it is worth noting that there is ample on-street parking in the neighborhood, and Geert was kind enough to arrange in advance for resident day parking permits for us to use.   For days that we traveled into London, we relied on public transportation and bought day passes which were a great value and allowed unlimited use of tube/bus/train.  

Throughout the experience from booking to departure, Geert took a genuine interest to see that we had a nice holiday and enjoyed our stay at his house. "
36299,26902939,42057,173167,Katharine,"This is a lovely place in a fantastic neighborhood. Geert was a very responsive and helpful host, and always got back to us within a few hours when we contacted him. He took care of everything, and we loved staying here!"
36299,29966380,42109,25001869,Rosy,"We needed a place to host a group of 5 adults and a baby and this flat was an excellent choice. Communication with Geert was very fluent and easy, the description and pictures were very accurate and Geert left a very detailed booklet with instructions which was very helpful. The fact that there is a garden was amazing for the youngest guest.
The area is lovely and there are many stores and restaurants around. Commuting to and from Heathrow airport and to city centre is very easy. Overall a fantastic experience, I would highly recommend it.
"
36299,32121894,42138,1827444,Cathrine,"This was a spacious and comfortable home, Geert was welcoming, flexible, and easy to communicate with. Would recommend."
36299,32957213,42148,13486820,Carrie,My family of five really enjoyed our time at the house! The amenities allowed us to pack lightly and proximity to the gardens was fantastic. Hampton Court Palace is just a 30 min bus ride away. Geert's instructions were thorough and very helpful. 
36299,39730670,42211,27738460,Scott,"Geert was an excellent host. All through the booking procedure Geert responded to messages very fast. When we arrived at the house there was a little booklet that Geert had prepared that clearly explained how to work various things and also give useful tips about the neighbourhood and suggestions of things to do while staying. Geert very kindly gave us a gift of New Zealand wine when we arrived (we are from New Zealand). After a long flight it was gratefully drunk!

The house was very comfortable and we felt immediately at ease in it.  Good location in beautiful Kew and close to a tube station. Would recommend this as a good place to stay while in London. Comfortable and secure. "
36299,52390707,42306,23320483,Robert,"Had a very nice stay in Kew, house was as advertised. Welcome pack was waiting for us on the kitchen table, with instructions, maps and parking information. 5-10min walk to Kew Gardens tube station, 15min walk to Kew Gardens Park. 5min walk to a large shopping area (clothes and food)."
36299,73186333,42497,50920790,Carl,"A fantastic apartment which was perfect for our needs. Geert left a welcome note, which included some local tricks and places to eat, and followed up on how we were settling in. Highly recommended."
36299,77231439,42520,20762745,Iain,"Geert's house was a brilliant place to explore the Kew area. Kew Gardens were amazing and the house is in a perfect location for walking everywhere. Close to the tube for access to central London, plus local pubs, restaurants, parks and of course the river. Car parking wasno problem. 
The house was immaculately clean, beds really comfortable and everything as described on airbnb. Geert was a perfect communicator and we would not hesitate in coming back !"
36299,80688056,42540,63644178,Troy,"The home was even better than our high expectations from the previous reviews.  Starting with a thorough set of instructions on how to operate the home, touching base during the stay and a welcoming Milk & OJ which our kids pounced on at 11PM when we arrived.  Clean, welcoming, great part of Kew, easy to access for trips into the City of London.  Geert's home was a fantastic stop on a long trip allowing our kids and us to recharge!  We could not have hoped for a better spot.  "
36299,82414912,42548,27049964,Beatriz,The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36299,83856773,42555,7796347,Jennifer,This house is very well located close to Kew Village and the river. It's a great base for exploring Richmond and all of London. I would really recommend it!
36299,85856985,42564,63589823,Deepak,"We stayed here for 5 nights. We wanted to get a feel of living near the river and parks in London. This stay helped us in achieving just that.

The house is quite near to the Kew gardens and 2 minutes walk to the river Thames. On the days we wanted to go to central London we used underground, for which station is at walking distance.

The house is quite nice with 3 bedrooms which suited perfectly for our family of 4. The house is quite airy and has good natural light. There is a large private garden.

The entire area is quite green and walk up to the river Thames is also quite scenic. Plenty of birds are audible and visible. Occasionally we see cats (and a fox once) - which my children loved.

Even though it is in a quiet residential neighborhood, super markets and shops less than 10 minutes walk. Reasonable pubs and restaurants are within walking distances.

The kitchen is quite large and well equipped. Utensils and cutlery are high quality. One bathroom is proper size. One toilet is quite small. One caution that there is no storage space for the guests.

Geert has provided plenty of information quite methodically in a set of printouts that made our stay quite enjoyable.

We enjoyed our stay here."
36299,89913424,42581,14114714,Thomas,Geert had everything ready and was very helpful explaining everything in a very useful guide. The house was very comfortable  and great for getting in and out of London while staying in a calm neighbourhood. It is a great option for a family stay.  We stayed with our three  youngish children. 
36299,121317558,42720,86174331,Juliette,Geert was very responsive and also extremely accommodating on check in and check out times which was very helpful.  House is in a great location and is very clean. 
36299,123260217,42732,7817511,Adam,"Great house, lovely location, perfect for our needs. Shame the TV and DVD system did not work, but could not fault the home and would definitely stay again."
36299,161171538,42903,22488024,Christian,This is a wonderful property. Kew is a lovely place and this house is perfect for small families. The kitchen is gorgeous and well equipped (Website hidden by Airbnb) within 10 min walk. 
36299,167351179,42922,3010918,Sandra,"Great location, kid friendly, has everything you need! Geert is super friendly, responsive and accommodating. There is also now a TV available which is connected to broadband.  "
36299,171848139,42935,14571578,Chantal,"Excellent location in quiet, peaceful part of greater London. Wonderful to stroll amongst the deers at Richmond Park and to visit the new ""Hive"" in Kew Gardens. We were particularly fortunate to have stunning weather which we could enjoy in the garden of the house with our children!"
36299,180030082,42956,40625567,Kate,"We had a wonderful stay in Kew Gardens while in town for a wedding thanks to Geert. The house was spacious, well-presented, and equipped. My husband and I have lived just down the road for nearly a decade so it was wonderful to be back in familiar surroundings in such a comfortable home. Would highly recommend!"
36299,182393481,42961,132475086,Ron,"Great house close to Kew and Richmond. Quiet road, no through traffic, but trains and planes can be heard. We had a good stay with a small baby."
36299,195355273,42997,42374462,Jim,"We had been looking for a house that allowed the flexibility for the family that was flying in for the wedding later in the week. This seemed to represent the location, location adage.  It's very useful that whilst parking is a premium, there are times other streets need to be used. But to be honest thats no great shakes, with the only periods been a voucher system, which Geert helps with. Upon arrival the house was presented as clean and ready to use. Information pack on the dining table. If your there the walks with kids are great. Getting into central London is a doddle with Kew Gardens station a walk away. Surrounding the station plenty of facilities and if all  else fails theres a retail park as well. Getting used to been under the flightpath is a novelty.  Everything is at hand to use should you prefer to cook at home. We tried eating out and eating in, and enjoyed having both of these options. If you need a lovely location or visiting Kew Gardens then I can't recommend enough Geert a very communicative host, thanks for the welcome beers!"
36299,199500914,43010,5073713,Juan,"Great place, wonderfully quiet neighborhood. All three of is enjoy our stay. The place is set up perfectly.   Its a quick drive into central london and there were plenty of food and drink options a short drive away. I'd recommend this place to everyone. And the hoat Geert was quick to reapond to emails."
36299,249421792,43192,121984788,Jennifer,"Geert was a great host, very responsive to queries, lots of information on the house and area.  Felt very welcome and comfortable in the house.  It’s not in the central tourist area, but was really quick to get anywhere you wanted (we were at the Museums quicker than our friends staying in Hyde Park).  Has many more amenities such as shops close by that made it convenient - and a quick escape from town on our day trips out West.  Our teenage children didn’t ask for the wifi password for over two days!!!"
36299,291136149,43296,130249739,Ruediger,Very nice house for a family or friends who want to stay in the lovely neighborhood of Kew / Richmond to start the journeys from there. Tube connection to London Underground is 5-10' walk. Nice host who responds quickly. We had a wonderful time there being 2 couples.
36299,297741055,43309,159118206,Leane,Great location and Geert provided detailed instructions and was amazing at getting back to us quickly with any questions.  
36299,305569877,43323,204239000,Graham,"This house was in a great location for a family trip to London, with the underground/overground trains only a 10 minute walk away. Plenty of space for a family of four and lots of local amenities within a short walk. The Kew Gardens Inn/Pub served excellent food, and gin. Kew Gardens itself was only a 15 minute walk away and is a day well spent."
36299,310277705,43331,87069756,Marty & Melanie,"Geert's home suited us really well with a young family. Geert was super responsive, helpful and full of advice. The location is great close to Heathrow and rail stations in west London, easy to get into the city centre. Kew Gardens is within easy walking distance (must see) as is the Thames. There is  big M&S close by for food. Proximity of the rail line and Heathrow flightpath may be a consideration if you are a light sleeper. "
36299,324544707,43360,12417092,James,Geert’s house is a gem. It’s stylish and cosy with a lovely little back garden and a great dining kitchen. It is only a short stroll from Kew Gardens and the tube. Geert was a really helpful and friendly host. We had a really lovey family holiday staying in his home.
36299,328543248,43369,90766436,Michael,Beautiful house very well situated. The stay was very comfortable and the host very accommodating and thoughtful! I will definitely stay here again.

Less than 10 minutes walk to the beautiful Kew Gardens and conveniently placed at walking distance from Kew Gardens train station, restaurants and shops. We highly recommend Geert’s place."
36299,355231789,43437,52766231,John,"I stayed at Geert's place with my sons and a friend in December 2019. Geert's communication before and during our stay was excellent. The house is as described - well located, clean and with all essential amenities.  We can also recommend the Buenos Aires steakhouse in Richmond, which is really good.  Thanks Geert for a great stay!"
36299,364195415,43464,216750397,Kornelius,Very nice and relaxing location in the suburbs of London
36299,404272028,43488,11435326,Dominique,Cosy house in a nice location near Kew Gardens. Geert was quick to respond and provided a lot of information about the house and area. Check in and out was super easy and he was flexible on the timings which was great.
36299,419109908,43527,17349857,Pascal,Lovely place very close to public transport and to amazing Kew Gardens

36299,472302972,43635,94075456,Marcela,Geert’s place is lovely a perfect english house  very closecto Kew. Gardens and Richmond área With Great connections to Central London. Tube is only a  5 min walk to district line station . It was the perfect location that our family of 5 needed. Communication with Geert was always easy and he was super flexible to adapt to our needs of schedule and check in and check out time. He provides a booklet with All the info about the house and the area. I hope his place is available for our next trip to London.  And thank you for the little present it was delicious!
36299,474736607,43639,167691813,Jennifer,"Period house in a great location for visiting Local area attractions ( National Archives and Kew Gardens) and convenient for public transport routes by rail, bus or boat!
Great host who is very helpful and communicative.
We really enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again soon."
36299,479631146,43647,250644756,Sara,Great location to explore Kew Gardens and easy access to London with tube station nearby! Great flat with lovely backyard space. We enjoyed using this as our base for exploring the London area.
36299,489680132,43663,251069760,Anthony,"Great location. Close to the tube, supermarket and a few good pubs. Gerry was a fantastic host. Can be a bit noisy with the tube"
36299,492444516,43667,2893663,Christian,"A wonderful house to unwind after a day in the centre of London. Recommended for families; Geert‘s house was very well equipped with everything we needed. We especially liked the location: Kew „village“ as we called it is a great place to explore, and the walks along the Thames are very peaceful. Thank you Geert for your advice and your flexibility with check-in times!"
36299,503600626,43683,99305224,Silvia,La casa di Geert è molto accogliente e confortevole. Ci siamo sentiti come a casa. Pur essendo lontana dal centro è ottimamente servita dai mezzi pubblici. Zona tranquilla e residenziale
36299,521925485,43709,2362757,Claire,"The house is in a great location, friendly, local area, comfortable, clean house, feels like a happy family home, full of lovingly restored furniture and interesting books."
36299,540301357,43741,54900526,Daniel,"We had a terrific stay at Geert’s place in the early autumn. This is a nice place with 3 good sized bedrooms and one large bathroom, with a convenient downstairs half bath. The location is excellent, about an 8 min walk from the Kew Gardens station and there are several nice restaurants within a 6-10 minute walk. The backyard was nice to look at, but since it rained often during our stay we didn’t spend any time enjoying the yard. The kitchen had all the appliances and utensils needed for cooking meals, and there was also an office and a cozy front living room to spend time in as well. Hotly recommend."
36299,554468099,43764,160629721,Kartikay,"Absolutely amazing place. It far exceeded all expectations. Geert was helpful with communication, the space was clean, and it was close to the National Archives!"
36299,556677043,43768,131901657,Mark,"The house was spotless when we arrived.  A great location, just a short walk from Kew Gardens station. Close to the rail line but that didn't bother us in the slightest.

The house has everything we needed and there were detailed instructions for the appliances written in a way that made us smile. There was also a helpful guide to local shops bars and restaurants.

We would definitely stay there again."
36299,655376406,44066,362897376,Hrh,"If you want to stay in a nice part of London then this ticks the box. Just be prepared that this place is not a typical holiday home. It’s the owner, Geert’s home which he vacates for the duration of the stay, or at least this was the case for us. It wasn’t really set up for a family holiday as such as the house was very much actively still being lived in by Geert. It was quite cluttered. There wardrobes were full of his clothes, the freezer and part of the fridge stocked with his food and the living room was set out for him with no way for us all to chill out, as there’s just one sofa and a few metal dining chairs in there. Also be aware that it’s in the Heathrow flight path and very close to the train line. It’s quite noisy and expect to woken up early. Parking is fine, if somewhat tight, with people not leaving much space and the road is safe. During the week, a permit is needed for your car. Geert provided us with these for the two days we needed them. 

Geert seems like a nice chap and communicated well. He had alluded to the fact the place needed some TLC and there was a bit of clutter in one area but I wasn’t quite prepared for the reality. It was very expensive overall and the £100 partial refund we received, although very much appreciated, didn’t quite seem enough to make up for the discrepancy in what we were expecting versus the reality of what we found."
36299,659027742,44074,55887247,John,Gorgeous house in beautiful location. Great communication and geert went out of his way to make sure trip went well for us. Would definity stay again
36660,96819,40435,174592,Jennifer,I stayed at Agri's B&B for 4 nights and it was a delightful stay. Agri was very accommodating and nice and made sure we had all the necessary things. I would stay there again if I return back to London. Thank you Agri!
36660,102920,40443,220055,Bernie,"Great b/b,great hospitality,felt like we were at home.Lovely garden and terrace and two lively cats. Full marks. Jim 7 Bernie"
36660,106485,40448,227691,Amy,We absolutely loved our time with Roger and Agri.  They are wonderful hosts.  We would be happy to stay with them again if we are back in London!
36660,112474,40456,243317,Jean Miguel & Jamie,"Wonderful experience, great B&B to stay at. Agri and her husband are very friendly. My wife and I had such a great time. We would recommend them to anyone who wants a comfortable place to stay. House is very close to the Metro (tube). No problem at all. Agri is a great resource for any questions about London. Breakfast was 5 Stars, room very clean, beautiful patio and backyard. We stayed 2 days in October 2010. My wife and I are even planning a trip with our children within the next year and we would return to the same place if it was available. Thank you again Agri!!!"
36660,116159,40462,48138,Klaus,"One of the best travel experience with Airbnb to date. Location is great, 5 minutes by foot from the East Finchley underground and bus stop (18 minutes with the tube to the center of London), a lot of shops and meal opportunities (fast food and slow food, plus 2 big and cheap supermarkets) right outside the door.
What can you ask more? The kindness!!! Agri and his husband are GREAT, helpful and funny people, always ready to help out with every tourist need, and at the same time with the discretion needed to hold an acommodation.
The room was big, ultra tidy and with a delicious view to a relaxing garden. There were also adapters for the UK power socket! And the breakfast was delicious, handmade scones and everything you could think of will help you start the day in the best way, even if you get up a little later :-)
All in all you could not miss this, and I hope to get back here my next time in London!"
36660,118246,40464,213193,Enrica,"Great location, 5 minutes walk to East Finchley tube station and half an hour to London center.  Room was clean and big.  Breakfast was good.  Agri and Roger are fantastic host.  Definitely would stay there again."
36660,120647,40468,214078,Bonnie,Very very nice host and house
36660,124569,40473,252263,Randy,"I had a WONDERFUL stay. I DEFINITELY recommend staying with Agri and Roger. Agri was out of town when I stayed but Roger and Agri's sister, Fibe, took excellent care of me. I have nothing but positive things to say about my stay. The home is charming. It is easy to get to their home from the tube. Agri gives excellent, precise, directions once you've confirmed your reservation. 

Roger and Fibe were amazing hosts and made me felt like I was coming home again rather than staying somewhere I had not been before, which was the case.  I had not yet stayed there. My room was immaculate with a very comfortable bed. There is a huge, beautiful backyard; it is a wonderful home. I was welcome one evening to watch a soccer match with Roger in the living room. It truly was like a home away from home. The neighborhood is very nice as well.

My last morning I had to leave very early, about 5:15am, and Fibe got up that early to make me coffee. I was truly spoiled. 

If you have the chance to stay with Agri and Roger, I recommend doing so 100%!"
36660,125913,40475,258088,Umar,"Was a great experience, wish I had stayed longer! The host was very kind and respectful."
36660,130059,40481,253067,Patricia,Agri is amazing and that is why I picked her place a second time around.
36660,130724,40482,238955,Phil,"Very nice time - well run, clean and friendly place to stay - thanks for a pleasant stay. Highly recommended"
36660,131225,40483,252028,Jesper,"We had a fantastic stay with Agri and Roger.

We felt at home and relaxed in the house and Agri served a very nice breakfast every morning. We will definitely be back another time. "
36660,133409,40486,258341,Matthew,"Agri and Roger were great hosts.
Very sweet and accommodating with a lovely, peaceful setting.
I'd definitely stay there again when in London. 
"
36660,134554,40489,235601,Mallory,"Agri and her husband were godsend's during our stay. They were our last stop after 2 weeks of traveling, and it was great. Agri was incredibly kind and thoughtful - going above and beyond anything I would have ever expected. The house is very comfortable, the garden is lovely, and it's very easy to get around thanks to their proximity to the underground.
My sister and I loved staying here, and definitely recommend it."
36660,135211,40490,254489,Basak,"The lovely house of Agri and Roger was our first Airbnb experience. It was absolutely much more than we've ever expected. A perfect, big, clean, very well organized room filled with everything you may need + a breakfast that includes anything you may want with an impressing, very British style of dish set. Both Agri and Roger are very helpful and they definitely enrich your stay with their advices about the city and the neighborhood! I wish we could stay more than a night. But at least now we know where we will stay whenever we are in London!"
36660,136829,40492,261828,Steve,"I am a Professional Consultant with my own company and I am always looking for quality deals for accommodation, believe me, you will not get much better than this, it is undoubtedly one of the best places I have stayed in London on this site, its almost perfect, Agri is very welcoming and wants to make you feel at home right from the start, I would stay there again anytime.

"
36660,137662,40494,267801,Marcos,"Fantastic trip! I only had the chance to stay for one night, but i enjoyed the stay and the fords' hospitality. I had a large bedroom with desk and great view outside. Agri was fantastically warm and welcoming and made me feel at home instantly.

The house is a quick walk from the tube stop which is near a great pub as well!

Compared to other places i've stayed in central london, this was a superlative choice and at a fantastic price. Had i the opportunity, i would have spent more of my stay here. Would highly recommend to others!"
36660,140642,40499,216243,Lone Kathrine,"I highly recommend a stay with Agri and her husbond. They are both very friendly and helpful. The rooms and sorroundings are very nice and clean and comfortable and the breakfast was simply fantastic - served with tea or coffee made just the way you prefer it :-)
I stayed for 6 days and was happy with everything. The only little thing that one might be a little unhappy about is that it takes about 25 min with the tube to get to the center of London - but then again, what does that really matter. If I go back to visit London again I will defenitely stay here!"
36660,141824,40502,127457,Valentina,We spent more days in Agri&Roger's home and they were great!!!
36660,144745,40508,275120,Ralf,"I had the pleasure to enjoy Agri's place together with my wive for a three-day London trip. We felt very welcome by Agri and Roger.
The room was very nice and clean - just to feel like home. Breakfast was great and the house is close to an underground station with direct connection to the city centre - ideal for everyone who wants to discover the highlights of London.
We can recommend Agri for everyone who is traveling to London. They are just great!
Thanks Agri and we will make sure to book with you for our next trip to the wonderful city of London.
"
36660,146157,40511,255465,Florian,"It was a fantastic stay. The room was as discribed very beautiful and the breakfast was more than I expected and therefore great too. I would recommend staying there. There's no problem with zone 3, it took us 22min. to get to the city. "
36660,148928,40517,257830,Anne,"I have stayed with Agri and Roger for nearly 1 1/2 months while relocating to London, and it has been an absolute pleasure all the way.

Agri and Roger are probably the nicest people in the world. They are wonderful and helpful and instantly make you feel welcome and at home. It's easy to tell that they both enjoy having guests in their house. And don't even get me started on the great coffee and Agri's delicious homemade scones...

The house is beautiful with views to a nice garden, the rooms are big and comfortable and true to the pictures. It's a 5 minute walk to the station and from there direct access to Central London with Leicester Square only 20 minutes away by Underground.
"
36660,153366,40525,309156,Sarah,We had a lovely stay with Agri and Roger. They were perfect hosts and made sure we were well looked after. It was so nice to stay in a home after weeks on the road - a great change from hotels and hostels. Their house is just beautiful and in a great location with easy public transport links - not too far out of the city centre but far enough to catch your breath and enjoy a little peace and quiet. Ideal also if you are coming o going from Kings Cross St Pancras. Will def stay again next time we are in London and would recommend to others.
36660,155573,40531,241103,Linh,"Agri and her husband are lovely hosts who not only let us use their home but really welcomed us and made our time in London so enjoyable. Their house is really cozy and warm, they provided us with internet access and gave us really detailed instructions on how to get to their home and even picked us up. Breakfast was delicious, but it is their warm and welcoming personalities that makes staying with them so worthwhile!"
36660,159318,40540,280449,Ania,"Agri and Roger are a wonderful couple!  They will make you feel like part of the family when you stay with them.  Our room was great, very spacious, comfortable bed, TV, etc.  The house was beautiful and located very close to the metro which was only a 25 min tube ride to Leicester Square.  They had a wonderful table with breakfast prepared every morning!  My boyfriend and I stayed here over the Christmas Holiday and they even prepared for us a traditional English dinner!  They are really amazing hosts and I would DEFINITELY recommend staying here while visiting London.  Thank you very much Agri and Roger, hope to see you (and Brian ;) soon!"
36660,160787,40543,230993,James,"Staying withAgri and Rodger was just like being at home.
we both felt extremely happy to have been treated so well as this was our first experience of an Airbnb place to stay and theirs was our first of a series of short stays in europe for the first time ever .
Coming all the way from New Zealand we had a little apprehension and this was totally disapated as soon as their door was opened to us.
A nicer couple will be hard to find and should we ever visit the UK again ,we will know where to stay for sure.
Thanks again Agri and Rodger and other guests."
36660,162786,40545,316627,Jamie,"Agri and Roger were very accomidating in our arrival time as well as making it possible to extend our stay they make you feel right at home and help with any questions you may have about London, the transit is real close and there are lots of shops and resurauts a short walk up the street..breakfast was delicious and coffe always fresh .. looking forward to my return stay when I bring my Husband.. thanks again for everything"
36660,165935,40548,275319,Stephanie,"This room was very spaciouse and clean, and breakfast every morning was excellent!  Also it is very conventient since it is very close to the underground.  It is about a half hour ride to get to downtown London on the underground."
36660,168798,40553,307778,Frank,"Agri family is a most lovely family that I have ever been with. Thanks for the very nice and warm hospitality for 3 days in London. I would like to visit again.
"
36660,168900,40553,322304,Dawn,"I stayed with Roger and Agri for 2 night/2 days.  It was wonderful and I  wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  I felt like family!!!! Their home is LOVELY and very close to the Tube.  It felt a LOT more comfortable than staying in a hotel.  This was my first stay with Air BNB and it was excellent.  I was nervous about getting lost, but it was NO problem.  Roger and Agri were VERY helpful in orienting me to London.  It was a wonderful weekend trip!"
36660,170371,40557,318566,Melanie,"After an extremely long transatlantic flight, I was exhausted and in need of some quiet and a long sleep. Immediately, upon walking into Agri and Roger's home I felt calm and right at home. Roger made me a lovely cup of tea and showed me my amazing room! Overlooking the garden, very clean and large. There were books to read, dvds to watch, had I not been so tired I would have taken advantage of the nice library in the room. The upscale neighborhood was very central (on the Northern line, easy to transfer to the Picadilly line to get anywhere if you are in London on business, as I was) and there was also wonderful food at a couple of the pubs I visted late night after my business meetings. Agri and Roger are the most lovely couple, and make any female traveling alone feel safe. Agri even lent me her umbrella for the weekend when I mentioned I needed to buy one. They are so sweet and I look forward to my stay there in a couple of weeks when I return to London again on business. I think I've found my permanent home when I travel to London! ps...try Agri's homemade scones...best I've ever tasted."
36660,172714,40563,325183,Nika,"I have found my new homebase for any visit I make to London!  Agri and Roger made me so welcome and comfortable from the minute I stepped in the door from a long train trip on a wet evening.  In minutes, I was comfy in the living room with a cuppa tea and conversation.  My room was ready, lovely and warm, with plenty of closet space, and the bath was just a step away.

Breakfast was so enjoyable each morning, with many food options, easy conversation and a gorgeous view of the back garden - this made a great start to each of my busy days on this business trip.  I also felt right at home tucking up in my room one day, just taking it easy.

Access to the tube station is a couple of minutes walk.  I ate in the Old White Lion pub next door to the tube several times and really enjoyed the menu offerings.  Close by, the high street offers cafes, shops and a small pharmacy.

Thank you Agri and Roger!  Your place is the best!  I've already recommended it to several friends and colleagues.  See you next time!"
36660,174638,40568,326364,Paola,"It was amazing to stay at Agri and Roger's house, they are adorable and warm people, yet very respectfull of intimacy. 

The breakfast in front of the big garden is delicious, the room and the bed very confortable with all these details that make the difference (hairdryer, filtered water and glasses, many hooks, towels and drawers). 

The whole home is welcoming and peacefull, and has the most adorable guardians, 2 cats, Brian and Bam Bam.


"
36660,177527,40576,318566,Melanie,Roger and Agri are a delight to be around. This was my second stay at their B&B and I intend on making it my permanent lodgings whenever I come to London on business or pleasure. I met so many wonderful people staying there and it is such a warm and cozy atmosphere to be in. Feels like a home away from home! Thank you so much for the wonderful experience.
36660,178884,40580,138386,Isabella & Gary,Best place to stay in London!
36660,179501,40581,342669,Joe,"We stayed with the Ford family for three nights on our Euro Trip. (A first night in London then the last two nights, separated by a week). They were extremely kind people. We loved the cats and the homely feel. The one downside is it is a little farther from London proper than I would have hoped but it turned out to be a nonissue for us.

The breakfast was delicious and I also highly recommend eating at the Old White Lion."
36660,181036,40586,331873,Jørgen,"As soon as you enter Blenheim Lodge at Roger´s and Agri´s you feel welcome. They are very helpful and can answer any question you may have about London. Even in terms of transportation around town.
The room is nice and large with a comfortable double bed. There is easy access to toilets and showers and it is clean and tidy everywhere.
Thanks for a wonderful stay. We would like to come again.

36660,199571,40617,335730,Miah,"A perfect home away from home when visiting London. Quiet, cozy, and very comfortable. Agri and Roger do their utmost to make you feel at ease and take very good care of you. Tasty, substantial breakfast; large, nicely decorated, and clean rooms with homey touches (like a big chair and vanity table); and an easy underground ride to the center of London. Loved my stay chez Agri and will be back soon!"
36660,201486,40619,407713,Deanna,"Agri and Roger are very accommodating hosts.  THis is a very nice, peaceful and beautiful place to call home when in the London area. Recommend highly.    "
36660,204452,40623,344256,Simone,"It's a beautiful house, with a lovely garden. Agri and Roger are very kind, I absolutly suggest this place, that is not far from the city center (15 minutes by underground). The breakfast is rich and the rooms are cosy and clean. You won't want to leave."

36660,214152,40634,275023,John,"This room lives up to and surpasses its guarantee! We visited in late March and the gardens of London were in full bloom, including the one at this place. We enjoyed the hosts who were very kind and the breakfast they provided was a spread to see. We recommend this place 100% to all manner of travelers."
36660,215033,40635,158660,Elizabeth,"This is the best Bed and Breakfast that I have ever had the pleasure of staying in on my travels. Roger and Agri have a beautiful home to share while visiting London! This is the second time I've stayed here, and I love it. It's my ""home away from home"" and I highly recommend it! Blenheim lodge is very clean, comfortable, quiet, cozy, and you couldn't ask for more hospitable and gracious hosts. I will visit again and again. :-)"
36660,218942,40639,158660,Elizabeth,"Blenheim Lodge is a terrific place to stay while you are visiting London. Agri and Rodger provide beautiful, welcoming, comfortable lodging and you will feel right at home. It is quiet and clean, cozy and warm. The location is great because the buses and the Underground and very close, and it only take about 20-30 min to get into central London. I highly recommend staying here, and have been here for two different trips to London. My mom loved it here as well! :-)"
36660,222767,40644,403969,Brigitte,"Agri and her husband welcomed us with afternoon tea.  Their hospitality was outstanding.  The accommodation is comfortable and very pretty.  We had had unexpected changes in our travel plans and Agri helped us find maps, did last minute washing and provided a very early breakfast.  She went way over and above what would be expected of a host.  We can't recommend her highly enough and we thank her from the bottom of our hearts.  
Gitti and Michaela"
36660,224663,40645,404856,Travis,This is a lovely room with a beautiful view of the gorgeous backyard. All of Roger's tulips are in bloom and makes for a lovely experience. 
36660,225337,40646,227431,Gretchen,"A beautiful home with an even more stunning garden, two wonderfully friendly cats and amazing hosts! We loved our brief stay here, just a few minutes from the nearest tube stop and equally near an excellent pub with excellent food. Breakfast in the morning was also wonderful- especially the homemade scones! Our room was even outfitted with a nice big TV and selection of DVDs. Though a bit outside of central London (zone 3 rather than 1 or 2), I think the ride in to town would certainly be worth the incredibly pleasant stay!"
36660,226868,40648,335730,Miah,"We had a nice stay with Agri and Roger, though it was not as great as the previous visit. There were a few hitches, but the were fixed promptly. All and all, it was a nice place to stay, with easy access to all of London.
"
36660,235222,40655,404856,Travis,This is one of our favorite rooms! The bedroom door opens up onto a lovely sitting area in the beautiful back garden. Very clean. Highly recommend this room!
36660,240808,40659,444168,Ajay,"Wonderful Host + Heavenly Accommodation + Fascinating Garden is how I would describe my short stay here. If possible I would never like to leave that accommodation but after all I was a guest. They are such an accommodating hosts to take care of minor likes / dislikes of their guests that Agri allowed my wife to make tea of her own liking and served me hot milk in breakfast. Agri ! we are really thankful to you for that gesture. Frankly, from previous feedbacks I was sure of a wonderful experience there but actual experience surpassed all my expectations. They are the best hosts I have ever come across in my life. Now we can't think of any other accommodation whenever we need to stay in London."
36660,247914,40665,452605,Roberto,"My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights at Agri and Rogers beautiful little BnB in London. Our stay was outstanding, with absolutley no complaints of any kind. Agri and Rodger were lovely and so were their adorable cats Bam Bam and Brian. Breakfast was always awesome and the metro is super close so it was easy to get around.If we are ever in London again we would definetly stay here! "
36660,250766,40666,548135,Bijan,"It was just fantastic - I did not have much time to enjoy the stay, but I really felt like at home from the second I entered the house. Everything is just lovely, and Agri and her husband are very nice people. Very good!"
36660,256267,40672,401803,Herbert,"My first reaction to writing this is ""awe do I  ** HAVE ** to tell the world about my new home away from home in London?"".  Agri and Roger were made for this.  Blemheim Lodge is close to the East Finchley stop and here's what you can look forward to: the absolute kindest hosts that you are ever going to meet in London. Don't get up and leave too soon to see the sights though, Agri puts out a wonderful breakfast for her guests and if you don't try her homemade scones, you are missing something spectacular. I truly cannot recommend Blenheim enough. Thank you Roger and Agri for having such a wonderful home away from home for me. I will stay no other place now."
36660,261661,40676,449377,Dj,"Next time I'm in London I will definitely book my stay at Agri's home.  The room was clean, comfortable and large.  Breakfasts were my favorite time.  The food was delicious and  several other guests would be there and we'd swap our best London travel tips with each other.  
Agri also was very helpful with places to see as well.  Great place to stay!  
"
36660,265382,40679,467229,Julie,"My friend and I stayed with Agri for 5 days.  We received a warm welcome and felt like we were staying with family.  We preferred not to share a bed, and Agri had another bed set up in the room for us. We booked late, but Agri was stlil able to accomodate us, by having us switch rooms once.  Both rooms were excellent.  The 2 rooms that we stayed in downstairs share a bathroom, but we didn't find this a problem.  Anything we needed, Agri was more than happy to provide.  She can tell you exactly how to get around as well.  Breakfast was great, with a lot of choices.  The tube station is a short walk (maybe 5-ish minutes) and the bus stops are even closer.  There is a grocery store just past the tube station.  I would definitely stay here again."
36660,272019,40683,507895,Alexandre,"Agri leaves in a beautiful house... It is realy like you can see on the pictures ! Not far from the centre of London, not far from the Tube, it is realy perfect. Agri is realy nice, we had a HUDGE breakfast, we didn't eat again before 3 pm What I liked is the fact that Agri host people since many years and you can feel that as soon as you contact her."
36660,273979,40684,586043,Oliver,"Had to make a last minute booking to stay in London. The price was great and as a result I was a little unsure about the quality.

Agri was very responsive beforehand with emails and was very prompt.

I received a very warm welcome when I arrived and I immediately felt at home!  The room was exactly as you see it in the photo, yet that doesn't include the great ground floor views of the garden.

The shared bathroom was on my floor and was never in use when I needed it.

Although I was there for one night, I was in and out of the city on the tube all the time.  Luckily all my stops were on the Northern Line and the nearest stop was an easy 5 minute walk from the house.

I'd definitely stop here again."
36660,289408,40694,240690,Laura,"Agri and Roger were extremely hospitable and made us feel at home during our 11 day stay. Their home was beautiful and clean. There was a nice breakfast spread each morning, and Agri went out of her way to accommodate our special dietary needs. The house is in a lovely area in northern London. The underground station is a 5 minute walk from the house, and it only took us about 20-30 minutes to ride into central London each day to sightsee. I would definitely stay here again in the future!"
36660,296477,40698,376572,Rachel & Ben,"Agri is such a welcoming host, and after a 24hr flight, being ushered inside to a cup of tea was pure bliss.

The rooms are a wonderful size, the house is gorgeous and has a history to it, and it is situated in a beautifully quiet area.

Agri's breakfast buffet is definitely something to NOT be missed - overflowing with options it was a beautiful way to begin each London day.

If you're after a place with friendly, accomodating and generous hosts, large and clean rooms, look no further."
36660,297796,40699,334414,Tammi,"We came back to Roger and Agri after a few days away in Bath, and were able to stay in another room at the Blenheim. This one was smaller, I'd say more cozy, but this time we got a visit from Brian, one of the house cats! We were so pleased as this was near the end of our long vacation and we missed our cat so much.
The bed was so comfortable and Agri was kind enough to let us have breakfast a bit early so we could make our early flight. (Word to wise for those going to the airport ... remember that it takes 20-30 minutes to get from East Finchley to central London on a Saturday, then ANOTHER 45 minutes out to the airport!)"
36660,306831,40704,557036,Jay,We were made to feel welcome and at home while staying at Agri's place. She gave us lot's of useful  inside tourist information to make your getting around London easier and more fun. We will look forward to staying here again!  
36660,325001,40714,453020,Lisa,"My partner and I stayed in the in guaranted to love it room with the beautiful view of the large gardens. We stayed for short time and wish we had more time to speak with Agri, Roger and their lovely guests. The home is 'lived in', very clean and has a country feel to it. the room was next door to the large shared bathroom which again was clean. 
The area where the guesthouse is is lovely and has a great variety of eateries only about 5/10 minutes walk; infact we ate at a lovely south indian restaurant in the high street called cochin.There is a japanese, greek, italian and other restaurants locally.
if we return to London again, we would most certainly return to stay at Agri and Rogers home. "
36660,327013,40715,517753,Lala Ema,"The title says it all...yes, we LOVED that room !! It's quite exceptional to wake up in the morning and see this beautiful garden, flowers all around...A real pleasure !! And surely the best way to start the day :-)"

36660,339463,40722,174439,Sarah,"I highly recommend this place! It's very well located, near the subway station which take you in nearly 10-15min in the main stations. The host are very kind and will help you if you need it! The place is juste lovely! The Breakfast is also a very good way to start the day, the view on the garden and the large choice of food and drinks makes it perfect! "
36660,358071,40731,338907,Barbara,"Agri and Roger were just delightful hosts, friendly, warm and helpful.  Well before I arrived in London, Agri had been helpful in every way with my queries.  

I loved my room with its exquisite garden view.  To be greeted by Agri at the end of the day with, ""can I make you some tea,"" made me feel so at home.  Her home was like a cocoon for me, which, as a solo traveler, I really appreciated.

The local pub, The White Lion, was a great place for dinner after a day of touring and the nearby tube got me into central London in 20 minutes.  Also, a 20-minute walk from Agri's and Roger's is Hampstead Heath, the huge, beautiful park.

In short, I could not have enjoyed my stay with Agri and Roger more and I would stay there again without hesitation.  I hope it's soon!"
36660,367965,40736,400176,Sharon,"The Blenheim Lodge was a great place to stay.  Walking distance to public transport, stores, restaurants, and laundry.  Agri and Roger are great hosts and are very helpful and welcoming.  Loved the homemade scones and conversation at breakfast.  Brian and Bam Bam (cats) were an enjoyable part of our stay.  We would stay here again when we return to London."
36660,382320,40743,397753,Elizabeth,"I had such a lovely  stay with Agri and Roger. They were  very welcoming,approachable and friendly hosts. It was really nice area and I had a enjoyable and comfortable stay . Thankyou Agri and Roger I am looking forward to coming again."
36660,385015,40744,524893,Catherine,"One word- Perfect. This is EXACTLY what a Bed&Breakfast should be like- quaint, beautiful, & a relaxing oasis to a day of traveling. Agri & Roger were beyond amazing hosts. They not only shared their home with me but their joys of cooking, entertaining guests, & gardening. Their home is absolutely lovely and their garden is to die for. Would absolutely love to stay here again on my next trip to the UK! "
36660,420739,40760,451053,Emilie,"Agri and Roger are wonderful hosts. We appreciated their great hospitality. It was a real pleasure to stay in this beautiful house for a week.  Everything was clean, comfortable and quiet, the breakfast was excellent and the backyard was gorgeous. Next time, we won't hesitate to book a stay in Blenheim Lodge again. We highly recommend them!"
36660,424609,40761,890286,Rona,"I stayed at Blenheim Lodge for 5 days with my young daughter and had such a lovely time that I will definately be back in the near future. The room was spotless and so clean and fresh. There were books and magazines to read and a TV with freeview and DVD and so many small touches that it really had the warmth of a home from home. Agri is such a lovely host and it was so nice having breakfast with the backdrop of a wonderful garden to gaze at. The other guests were all delightful and I found breakfast a really interesting and relaxing time, hearing what everyone was up to for the day. All in all a true gem ... I'm not sure I should be telling everyone as I'd love to keep this place a secret find for myself!!!! Highly recommended and next to a tube station so you're in the heart of London at Leicester Square in 15 mins and then equally with the beauty of North London to retreat to. What more could anyone want."

The location is perfect if you are looking for a calm neighborhood, near a subway station, bus lines and a traditional english pub."
36660,494848,40788,688590,Rob,This was a lovely place. Unforgettable hospitality. I highly recommend this place and the pleasure of meeting Roger and Agri.
36660,556345,40808,874943,Mary,"Agri and Roger made our stay absolutely perfect. Not only is their B&B located conveniently for the London Underground and situated in a pleasant neighborhood; Agri's breakfast in a true delight - fruits, cereals, pastries, coffee, tea - you'll walk away ready for a day of tourist attractions. We were able to use a computer to print our boarding passes and Agri and Roger were eager to answer any questions we might have. You are sure to a have a wondrous time and look eagerly forward to your next visit - as we do. Thanks so much, Mary & Mike"
36660,588157,40818,463383,Margaret,"It was a wonderful experience to stay in the comfort of Blenheim Lodge for a month, enjoying the generous welcome of Roger & Agri. This Heritage House is a charming, restful & heart-warming place from which to enjoy all the delights that London has to offer. It was a holiday of a lifetime greatly enhanced by the quality of the accommodation & the outstanding hospitality of our great hosts, Roger & Agri. If we're lucky enough to travel from Australia to London again, that's where we'd want to stay!!

36660,605394,40823,588949,Crystal,"We loved staying with Roger and Agri. Their place was lovely. We stayed in the garden room which had a private door leading out to the garden. Very spacious room, comfy bed, and although the bathroom was shared, we never ran into anyone else using it. Breakfast was a perfect start to each day. Really enjoyed meeting people from around the world.

This was our second time at their place and I will not hesitate to go there again. "

The moment I stepped into the house and this beautifully decorated room and view to garden  I felt calm and rested. On top of that Agri made me feel so comfortable and at home it was wonderful! I was even invited to sit on their huge comfy couch and have a cup of tea as if it was my house :) The breakfast is delicious and such a nice treat waiting for you in the morning . We had some really nice chats together.

The house is very spacious and the room and bathroom are spotless which definitely adds to the whole pleasant experience.  I will definitely be back here on my next stay in London!! "

I immediately felt at home as soon as walked through the front door. On lazy/sleep-in days, they have two really chill and friendly cats to keep you company as well (be sure to bring a lint roller to get their fur off your stuff).

I would definitely recommend Agri and Roger's place in the future and I will be sure to stay at their place whenever I return to London."

The bed was really comfortable and the towels were super fluffy!
Breakfast looking out into the garden was amazing to wake up to each morning. Thank you very much Agri and Roger for making our time in London so perfect. The Old White Lion pub just down the road is a great place to go for drinks and food as well. "

My room was absolutely a dream!  Comfortable bed, quiet and came with the most beautiful garden to walk out to.  Incredibly private and 5 mins to the West Finchely tube.  It was by the far probably the best experience I had ever had in my entire life and Ive stayed in many different types of bed and breakfasts all over the world.  I truly cannot say enough good things about staying here.  I miss it and will be returning in the future.
Thanks so much Agri, you were an amazing host, my boyfriend and I miss you~ take care."

When I misunderstood some directions that Roger gave me and walked a  mile in the opposite direction from their BnB, Roger willingly picked me up on a cold March Day.  I f I had a request, Roger really tried to accomodate. They are not liscensed to provide a full breakfast, but their continental offering is very good.  The room was clean, in great shape and  I felt that I had plenty of room as  a single person.  Their location was about 15-20 minute tube ride from central London while they were only about 400 metres from the East Flinchley underground. "

Both Roger and Agri helped in receiving my lost lagguages (while we were out), also helped arranging for taxis - something which made out stay so easy. The place is very convenience (closer to tube station) - and very quiet, clean and nice with dining room overlooking garden. I enjoyed very much my stay including reading books in the room, and really grateful with all their helps. "

36660,1109591,41010,1711837,Shao-Chen,"Agri & Roger are super nice hosts! And the house is wonderful! We had a great time in london.
East Finchley is a loving neighborhood which contain supermarkets, bars, restaurants, and everything you need!
The location is also very good. You can visit london's central spots within only 30 minutes. And come back home with the underground too.
Our room is super great that we can go to the loving garden just by opening the door. The bed is also super wonderful! 
Last, the breakfast is awesome! We were totally full every morning!
Lots of thanks to Agri & Roger.
We'll SURE come back to their place once we visit london again!"
36660,1110416,41011,1660958,Marcus,"How can I describe it? It was just great. The very warm welcome and this warm and very british house hooked me from the beginning. Roger and Agri are two of the most good-hearted people I have ever met.
Already the communication regarding booking and arrival were appealing, which is great since this was my first time with airbnb. During our stay they were incredebly helpful and friendly. Not forgetting the excellent breakfast and the beautiful rooms.
During our time in London the stay in Agri and Rogers house was not just an accomodation but one of the highlights of the whole trip.
I hope that we will come back in the near future and I definetly recommend everyone to come here."
36660,1188287,41026,1982433,Janet,"My daughter and I spent 7 days with Agri and Roger while visiting London. We had a wonderful stay in their lovely home. They are a warm and welcoming couple and we had  so much fun meeting the other guests. It was easy to take the underground into London and a great place to relax at the end of the day. I really enjoyed watching football (soccer) matches with Roger.

Hugs and caresses for Bambam and Brian, the two cats ;-)"
36660,1344485,41054,1813568,Dwight,"Agri is worthy of the title ""Superhost"". She had already put away everything for breakfast by the time we arrived but she brought everything out again - scones, butter, jelly, other pastries, and tea. We felt immediately welcomed. Breakfast is in a great setting too  - We loved the garden in the back. It was our first AirBNB experience, and we were really happy. Thank you Agri, Richard, and AirBNB!"
36660,1355248,41056,1826865,Frank,"Agri and Roger we're wonderful host and made us very welcome.  The room was spacious, very clean and bright.  The bed was very comfortable and we had two excellent night's sleep.  Breakfast was excellent with a large choice of cereals, fruit, yogurts and different types of bread and croissants.  There were other guests there all of which were very nice and we made some friends from Australia.  All in all, a great weekend and we will certainly stay there again."

We had a door from our room to the backyard with table and chairs that were nice to relax at when it wasn't raining.

Agri and Roger are the perfect hosts!

36660,1818242,41118,2330563,Briah,"We loved it!  Roger and Agri provided a wonderful experience for us.  Their home is lovely and the garden is beautiful.  It is very close to the train so it is easy to get around London.  We flew in late night and Roger and Agri were able to help us find affordable transportation from the air port.  Thank you so much for our wonderful stay, we would definitely go back.  "
36660,1965016,41134,468837,Sheila,"So glad we chose Blenheim Lodge for our London Olympic 2012 experience.  Roger and Agri made us feel so at home during our 8 day stay. I would highly recommend Blenheim Lodge to visitors to London.
It is situated in a perfect location. Close to the tube and bus for travel.
The White Lion down the road is a added bonus as well.
Thank you Agri and Roger for making are stay ""The Best""

36660,2026956,41140,131433,Carol,"My daughter and I stayed at the Lodge for one week. We had a great time. We loved the breakfast. The location is very good, 25-30 min to central London. The room and the bathroom were clean and the house was very quiet in spite of the number of guests. Agri and Roger are excelllent hosts and if we are back in London we will stay there again."
36660,2067207,41143,2321650,Marilyn,"We highly recommend Agri & Rogers beautiful Blenheim Lodge in London.  They are the perfect hosts and provide that quaint London experience we were looking for.  Both Agri & Roger go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and a part of their home.  The breakfast provided was absolutely perfect and we enjoyed the view of their beautiful english garden while sipping tea and preparing for our busy day of sightseeing.  This location is so convenient, a short 10 minute walk to the Tube system.  Our room was so comfortable and a welcoming end to our busy day, providing the best sleeps of our vacation.  
Thank you so much for making our holiday in London a perfect experience.

36660,2111898,41148,2849902,Joyce,"Had a wonderful stay! The place is beautiful, cozy and full of charm. I just loved the soft comfy bed and the smell of freshly laundered linen. There is a door that opens out into the spacious garden. Its just lovely to sit and read with a gorgeous view of the garden, or to play with the two cats- BamBam and Brian. The breakfast is wonderful as well. I got addicted to the coffee served. "
36660,2143037,41151,3002820,Angelika,"We had a wonderful time at Agri's and Roger's house. They are perfect hosts, who are thinking in advance, what might be good for the guests. It was a pleasure to meet them and always nice and inspiring to talk to them. Our room was lovely and very clean and it was a great joy to look at the wonderful garden. We can recommend this house and we would gladly come again. Thank you, Agri and Roger. "
36660,2256410,41162,2108427,Matias,"Amazing stay at Roger and Agri''s house!
It felt like home. Thanks for the great time!

Hope to come back soon to London!"
36660,2292033,41166,2105712,Jill,"Although I have stayed with Agri & Roger on a number of occasions this was my first stay in this delightful room, as with all the accommodation here the room was spacious and comfortable, and in this case with direct access to the lovely garden. Once again I cannot recommend Agri & Roger's as a great place to stay"
36660,2315641,41169,3177421,Lisa,My husband and I stayed at Agri and Roger's B&B 2 weeks ago for 2 nights and had a lovely stay. They were welcoming hosts and very friendly. We came in early Friday morning and they had a room ready for us and even gave us breakfast. The room was private and comfortable and very quiet. It was only a 5 minute walk to the tube and a 20 minute train ride to central London.We would highly recommend staying at Agri and Rogers's B&B and hope to return one day!
36660,2367523,41174,2021982,Gys,"Wonderful wonderful wonderful.  Although sadly Agri was away on holiday and we never got to meet her, we did get to meet her sister Fide and Agri's husband Roger.  Fide was extremely helpful and Roger was very friendly and always checked in on us to see if everything was OK.  The continental style breakfast was also wonderful and with more than enough food to choose from to start one's day.

A beautiful guest lodge, one we'd most certainly stay at again on our next trip to London.  We can recommend this place highly, so do yourself a favour and book with Agri and Roger, you won't be disappointed.  Agri and Roger's airbnb tag line of ""you're guaranteed to love this"" is spot on, in fact, a bit of an understatement.  You're more than guaranteed to love the place, in fact if you don't love it, I'll eat my hat!

Agri, thanks for the bubbly you left for us for our honeymoon, just sorry we never got to enjoy it, as we were out late most night, making the most of our short time (only 2.5days) in London.  A most thoughful gesture, thanks again for that personal touch!

We had the lovely ground floor garden room, opening up onto the patio, with a table and chairs outside our french doors, where we could smoke (as the lodge is non-smoking), so this was also wonderful.

Once again, thanks for an awesome experience!"
36660,2601896,41196,2587682,Julie,"I enjoyed my stay at Blenheim Lodge and this room was very nice.  It was spacious and the bed was comfortable.  It had a door opening out onto the garden with seating outside which was a unique bonus.  The bathroom with shower next to the room was clean and the breakfast room was cosy overlooking the lovely garden.  Great continental breakfast with cereals, toast, pastries, fruit, yogurt, juice, tea and coffee.  The hosts are lovely, Roger and his sister-in-law, Fide, looked after me and are very friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Agri as she was away overseas during my stay at the lodge.  The two cats, Brian and Bam Bam, were very inquisitive and liked all the attention the guests gave them.  The tube station is just a few minutes walk down the road and the Northern Line will take you straight into central London in less than half and hour.  I would recommend Blenheim Lodge to anyone wanting a nice, quiet, and welcoming place to stay in London."
36660,2650856,41200,3727443,Tommaso,"We spent a lovely time in this house, the room and the bathroom was absolutely clean and comfortable. I must thanks Roger and his kindness and patience despite our arrive at 2.00 AM. A really great host. "
