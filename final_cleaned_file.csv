"[""My girlfriend and I hadn't known Alina before we took the leap of faith to rent her flat. Alina just couldn't be nicer! Her flat is comfortable, homey, very sunny, and quiet at night. Her diverse neighborhood rocks! It's full of excellent eateries of varying ethnicities, good supermarkets, etc., etc. Her place is about a 10-minute walk to the Finsbury Park tube stop, and there are also several buses that ply Stroud Green Road. The Piccadilly and Victoria tube lines that serve Finsbury Park are very dependable and come frequently. My only caveat is if you are unwilling to take 20- to 40-minute commutes to downtown London attractions and money is no object, you will prefer to stay downtown. But for anyone else, you will love your experience of living in a real, untouristy neighborhood and dealing with a generous, warm-hearted woman I'm happy to call a new friend."", 'Alina was a really good host. The flat is clean and tidy - and really close to Finsbury Park station which is quite close to Central London. I recommend Alina to everyone. ', ""Alina is an amazing host. She made me feel right at home. It was more like hanging out with a friend than a complete stranger. She's very sweet and makes a mean espresso. There are tons of places right around flat to eat and market is close in case you want to cook. I would definitely stay here again if I was in London. Thanks Alina you're awesome."", ""Alina's place is so nice, the room is big and clean, and the bed is huge. Alina is a great host, and she made sure I had everything I needed, for instance she had put clean towels on the bed for me:) I felt very at home in her place. Aside from that she really helped me out with a lot of things, and even helped me find a permanent place to live in London. So overall a great place to stay with a great girl."", 'Nice location in Islington area, good for short business trip.

Alina is a great host, we felt us so welcomed by her! \r\nAlina's house location is very convenient, it's only 5 min walk to Finsbury Park tube station and also a direct (Picadilly) line to Heathrow Airport (in case yu have an early departure you can use the opportunity to sleep a bit in the train :) \r\nThe flat itself is very nice and clean and comfortable, especially the double-bed with new mattress, I slept like a newborn :) And also the red sofa on the small roof terrace is great, I enjoyed the last night London sky!\r\nTo all who is going to visit London I highly reccomend Alina and her beautiful house to stay in.

"[""We loved staying at Phillipa's place in Chelsea. The flat was lovely, and the neighborhood was great. Lots of fun shops, and close to two metro stops. We would love to stay there again!"", 'A comfortable apartment conveniently located near shops, restaurants and tube stations. \r\nPhilippa is a very helpful and friendly hostess. We would recommend her and her apartment to anyone.\r\nThank you Philippa for an enjoyable holiday.', ""I really enjoyed my week at Philippa's, the place is ideally situated in Chelsea, and she is a very kind host, I would definitely recommend that you stay there, I will again without any doubt. "", 'I am a little late reviewing this but it is important to me that I do.  Look, the place is in a great location and the neighbor was very friendly.  The place was perfectly comfortable and Philippa gave a lot of helpful information prior to our arrival in England.\r\n\r\nHowever, me and my girlfriend were robbed the second night we were there.  We went out to meet friends and by the time we got back, all of our valuables were taken (computers, iPods, camera equipment, jewelry, etc).  It was upon the arrival of the police that we learned two things:\r\n1)  Rooms here are rented out very, very frequently.  There are always people in and out so it is very obvious that there are tourists coming in and out of here.\r\n2) The locks, as explained by the police, are very inadequate at this location and can be circumvented with extremely simple tactics.\r\n\r\nThe most aggravating part of this was how we were treated.  We followed all instructions exactly as they were laid out and were very deliberate in making sure everything was perfectly secure as we went in and out of the place.  However, all correspondence with Philippa (through email or through her neighbor) indicated nothing other than it somehow being our fault.  There was very little sympathy and all the commentary centered around what WE did.  Additionally, Philippa basically just stopped replying to emails after we expressed how frustrated we were from her responses and the lack of security and safety in the building.\r\n\r\nSo, it is a nice place and a convenient location, but the threat of robbery (or God forbid attacks) is just simply too high here.', ""Very nice flat, and extremely well-located. Great for couples and single travelers. It is small and notes in the lobby indicate that the neighbors don't take kindly to noise--if you are a large family or group, this is probably not the place for you.\r\n\r\nPhilippa herself was a great host--I very much enjoyed meeting her. She left a great selection of helpful tourist info. "", 'This is a superior option to staying at a hotel in London, especially when considering the price of London hotels.  \r\n\r\nThe place is located in lovely Chelsea, seconds away from scores of shops, restaurants and pubs.  There is also a supermarket and cinema literally right around the corner.  If your only in London a few days and are primarily sight-seeing, the place is within walking distance to two metro stations and two or three tube stops to Westminister, Soho and Southbank  (about 20 mins total time).   A really great option for quick and easy access to central London with a quieter, trendy and less tourist neighbourhood to come home too.  And for anyone traveling from North America, London public transit is an absolute dream in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is very cute, perfectly clean and very well out-fitted.  Everything was recieved exactly as promised in the ad.  Phillipa was a kind and helpful host.  We would definitely recommend this place.  Great visit!', ""Within less than 10 minutes of South Kensington and 15 minutes of Sloane Square tube stations, there are several buses even closest to the apartment such as line 14, 19 and 11 (if I remember well). Some of the buses run all night so if you want to go out and are a little low on money for the cab you can always take one f them to go home!\r\nIt is ideal if you want to do some sightseeing and party in London while living in a nice and calm area. Of course you'll have to be very quiet while coming back home because it is a residential area and that's what make it so nice. \r\nLovely shop stores around on King's road, the Saatchi gallery is at 10 minutes walking, the grocery store is literally  around the corner.\r\nSaint-Pancras station for those who take the Eurostar is in the same tube station at 45 minutes top. Most of the tourist spots are within 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is very quiet at night a little less in the morning because it is located next to a store delivery parking. No worries then close the windows turn on the air conditioner or put some ear plugs if you are like me (light sleeper) it only lasts an hour.\r\n\r\nIt is exactly as indicated in the add. Beautiful natural light that makes it very bright. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom with fresh towels and toilet paper (seems silly to point it but very useful when you arrive late and haven't got time to go to the market) and an equipped kitchen. Everything you need for your stay as a true Londoner!\r\n\r\nPhilippa is a very lovely and warm lady. I am sure she will make your stay as comfortable as ours. \r\nI am glad I've met her and I hope next time I'll go to London her appartment will be free for me to rent it! \r\n\r\nThank you again for everything Philippa!! :) "", 'Wonderful location! 10min stroll to the tube and as we found out, fantastic bus connections to lots of sightseeing spots of London. \r\nHaving a well equipped kitchen and waitrose supermarket next door helps to whip up a good meal in pricy London. \r\nApartment is clean and cozy. \r\nPhilippa is very helpful and very welcoming. \r\nHighly recommend her apartment to all visitors looking to enjoy London for short and long stays.

I stayed here for a couple of days this summer and would definitely stay again. \r\n\r\nPhilippa was a bit hard to reach via phone / email at times, but I think I just caught her while she was doing some heavy traveling.

From the very beginning Philippa, our host, was informative, helpful and open. Philippa was unable to meet us but Mary her friend and neighbor helped us settle iin and offered us umbrellas for our rainy stay.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was wonderfully located with a supermarket, pastry shops and so many restaurants within walking distance, ie just around the corner. Ditto for public transportation - bus stop just around the corner that served us as ""tour"" buses since the routes went by every known site you could wish to visit. Within walking distance the Victoria and Albert museum and the Natural history musuem, the beautiful church of St. Luke with its gardens just at the end of the street.\r\n\r\nAnd the apartment itself was incredibly comfortable, with a washing machine and dishwasher and enough kitchen utensils for breakfast or any other meal you would want to prepare.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was exceptionally  quiet  in the evening with only the routine morning noise of the city of London waking in the morning.\r\n\r\nI recommend Philippa and her home  very highly and hope to return quite soon.\r\n\r\nRuth', ""Thank you for letting us stay in your beautiful flat.

We enjoyed being on the ground level for a change.

They undoubtedly will be stunning.\r\n\r\nSpecial note: I needed to fax a document back to the States and asked Philippa about businesses that provided those such as FedEx and MailBoxes Etc. There is a MBE near the South Kensington Underground however Philippa advised that her printer should do that (wouldn\'t connect for me as a scanner but worked fine as a copier/printer). The alternative were free services at the Town Hall across Kings Road. I ended up at the library at that building. William helped me join the library and then made an appointment for me at the computer station that would scan my document so I could send it as an attachment to an email.\r\n\r\n', 'Philippa was a very friendly, warm and caring host.

It was also an extremely convenient 2-minute walk to my office along with a variety of shops, restaurants, and pubs. The ground floor location was a bit strange at first, as I felt that people on the street could see me in the apartment, but it ended up not being an issue (just make sure to close the curtains when you need to). It also can get a little noisy, but my sleep wasn't very disturbed. Overall, a tremendous value for apartment quality and location."", ""It was a very nice stay. The apartment is exactly as described and has everything you could possibly need. We didn't get to meet Philippa but we could communicate and arrange everything for our arrival and departure.

The street is a bit noisy sometimes early in the morning. We would definitely choose this apartment again if we visited London."", 'You MUST stay here! I cannot recommend this place enough. Communication with Philippa before we arrived was great, and the instructions to get into the flat were simple and clear. After we arrived, we received a welcome e-mail from her, and although she was not in London at the time, we were able to reach out to her neighbour if we needed anything (which we did not). The flat had everything we needed, and was the perfect size for a couple. It was on the ground floor, which was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but we were able to close the curtains and felt very safe and secure in the building. \r\n\r\nChelsea is a very posh area and we felt very safe, even when coming home at 1AM in the morning one night. It is close to so many restaurants, great shopping, and is a 10 minute walk from the tube. It was also a great home base for sightseeing - we frequently only had to take one line (Circle/District) to get where we needed to go. \r\n\r\nI would definitely stay here again.', ""A wonderful find, just off the King's Road. Compact but with everything that you possibly want and more. What's more, the host kept in touch to the extent that she was mid Atlantic when she became aware of the heat wave we were enjoying and e-mailed me to remind me of the air conditioning unit. Service indeed. Would I stay there again? Yes! Would I recommend it to friends? Ofcourse!"", ""We knew the area well, so knew how convenient the location is. Everything at your fingertips. \r\nThere was a bit of noise during the day with local construction, but we were out most of the day so it wasn't an issue.

It was a clean (except for some silver fish in one of the bathrooms) and comfortable apartment.  I was not happy with the number of bathroom towels provided.  There were 5 of us so we were given 5 bath towels, 2 hand towels and no wash clothes.  We were there for 9 days and the washing machine broke early in our stay.  Our towels got a little ripe by the end or our stay. \r\n\r\nLiz was responsive when we emailed her, but I would have liked better communication on confirming our stay as it got closer.  We paid for the flat 6 months in advance because it was for the Olympics so I started to get worried when I did not hear from her.  I finally emailed her just over a week before we were to arrive to confirm our stay and find out how we were to access the flat.  When she responded, she confirmed the place but said nothing about accessing it.  Finally a day before we were to arrive she emailed the access info. \r\n\r\nLastly, The second day we were there the washing/dryer machine jammed and would not open.  Liz sent someone out to fix it and told us it was a broken handle, but didn't let us know it wouldn't be fixed until after we were gone.  We found this out only after sending an inquiring email.  She never once talked with us about paying for the repair.  When we got home we received an email from an Airbnb mediator to pay for the repair.   Through Airbnb we came to a compromise and paid half of the repair though we did not break the handle.

Surely, the best apartment i have ever been to. Firstly, Liz couldn't have been nicer to us!The flat was even better that in the pictures. Everything was great, (two bathrooms and 3 bedrooms). Location couldn't have been better. Everything was within walking distance(british museum, candem town, oxford circuss, pica dilly) or you could get the Warren Street Tube and you arrived everywhere in less than five minutes. The house was very near to Tesco Express and Salsbury Supermarkets, Pharmacies and everything you could ever head. Furthermore, the best night clubs in London (Libertine, Maddox and Cirque du Soire) were all a 15 minute walk. We stayed four days and we didn't have to pick any taxi!. The great majority of the Buses stopped in Tottenham Court Row(less than 3 minute walk from the house). \r\nI definitely recommend this house, as when we arrived, it couldn't be more clean. There was a dishwasher, washing machine, iron...everything you could need.\r\nWe didn't stay much on the flat as we went on a tourist trip, but it was extremely pleasant arriving to the flat,as it was great located and beds were extremely confortable.\r\nI wont regret staying again in Liz's apartment!"", 'Great location and great apartment !', 'Pictures are true to the apartment.

There is good informational material sent in advance to help with arrival, and good reference material in the flat.\r\nOne downside of being well located is that the flat tends to be very noisy at night. Directly across the street is a 140 room LSE student residence, and with a student pub on the street corner, there is a lot of activity directly below the flat between the pub and the residence. We stayed for seven nights, and basically every night was very noisy until late.\r\nThis three bedroom flat would be a decent place to stay for the money except for one thing - two of the three beds have extremely poor quality mattresses. Before renting the flat, I specifically asked Liz about the mattress quality, and she assured me that the mattresses were of good quality. Well this was unfortunately for me and my family a blatant misrepresentation. One bed has a decent double mattress. The other two beds have really really bad mattresses, the kind where the springs are to the surface and little or no support or padding. To make matters worse, one of the beds has broken slats, so you sort of ooze downward in the middle. I reported this after our first (sleepless) night, and Liz\'s partner Jack came over to the flat. I showed him the two bad mattresses, and he seemed surprised at how bad they were, said he agreed that they were not of acceptable quality, and that he\'d try to get them replaced immediately, but given it was a Saturday he said in all likelihood we wouldn\'t get new mattresses delivered until Monday. I said that was ok, and I appreciated his honesty about how bad the mattresses were, and his willingness to deal with the situation. Well, on Monday no mattresses arrived, nor any message from Jack or Liz about a change of plans. After two of my emails went unanswered, Liz finally answered to say that the existing mattresses were actually fine (!), that she\'s slept in the flat many times and that she\'s never had complaints before!!!! She didn\'t bother explaining how Jack could have been so wrong in his assessment. She had the nerve to tell me ""different beds suit different people I guess"". If the two mattresses were not of throw-away quality, why would Jack suggest replacing them immediately if they were not crappy?? The reason i\'m making a big deal of this, as I\'ve told Liz, is that the ONLY question I had of Liz before renting the flat was whether the mattresses were of decent quality.  She misrepresented the facts, and then despite her partner Jack agreeing with me, she would not admit she had lied to me. So buyer beware of what Liz has to say! I would suggest looking elsewhere.

She was concerned that we had been going in and out of rooms and felt the need to confront us in the middle of the night. She kept me up for 15 mins confronting and inquiring about when we were getting up, where we had been, etc. It was quite unpleasant considering that we had just arrived from Los Angeles and we were completely jet-lagged.

The house is also near a train track - which after a day or two I no longer noticed.  His descriptions of the size of rooms and beds is also accurate - some are small, but serve the purpose.

Most notably, we encountered some unexpected maintenance closures on the tube during our visit and Geert emailed me back before the next morning with several detailed maps and suggestions for alternate ways to get too and from central London.  What could have been a major headache on our holiday was no problem thanks to Geert\'s timely and practical advice. \r\n\r\nIf you do drive a car, it is worth noting that there is ample on-street parking in the neighborhood, and Geert was kind enough to arrange in advance for resident day parking permits for us to use.   For days that we traveled into London, we relied on public transportation and bought day passes which were a great value and allowed unlimited use of tube/bus/train.  \r\n\r\nThroughout the experience from booking to departure, Geert took a genuine interest to see that we had a nice holiday and enjoyed our stay at his house.

It wasn’t really set up for a family holiday as such as the house was very much actively still being lived in by Geert. It was quite cluttered. There wardrobes were full of his clothes, the freezer and part of the fridge stocked with his food and the living room was set out for him with no way for us all to chill out, as there’s just one sofa and a few metal dining chairs in there. Also be aware that it’s in the Heathrow flight path and very close to the train line. It’s quite noisy and expect to woken up early. Parking is fine, if somewhat tight, with people not leaving much space and the road is safe. During the week, a permit is needed for your car. Geert provided us with these for the two days we needed them. \n\nGeert seems like a nice chap and communicated well. He had alluded to the fact the place needed some TLC and there was a bit of clutter in one area but I wasn’t quite prepared for the reality.
